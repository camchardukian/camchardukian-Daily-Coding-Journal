# Tuesday August 20th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

19:57 -- Well, I've finally done it. I spent the last few weeks working at the headquarters of what is probably Vietnam's most famous language center.

After just a couple weeks working there, however, I knew that job at that company wasn't for me.

Fortunately, switching lanes... tomorrow is the day I "officially" become a web developer.

After 6ish months learning in 2016-2017 and another 9 months learning from 2018-2019, I'm starting my first full-time programming job tomorrow.

I'm excited, but also a bit nervous.

Today I got a massage so that I'd go in tomorrow loose, and ready to absorb information. I'm also going to try to get to sleep early tonight.

Before that, however, I'm going to spend an hour reviewing the basics of React so that I don't end up completely clueless if they throw me into some React problem tomorrow.

Let's go!

20:10 -- JSX is basically a pseudo language that allows us to write HTML within our JavaScript.

20:58 -- I just got through the first 25% of the Learn React for Free course. I wouldn't say I'm feeling super comfortable with everything again yet, but I definitely felt some of my React knowledge coming back.

Of course, I'm sure being in an environment that demands constant progress will be very motivating and contribute to my progress as a developer.

In any case, I'm going to upload this journal entry to GitHub, go get dinner, get some rest, and get ready for my first day working as a developer!
