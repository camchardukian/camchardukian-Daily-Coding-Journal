# Sunday August 25th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

19:46 — I’m just starting to get a little bit of coding in now. I’ve got quite a headache, and I’m a bit tired. I unexpectedly got called in to teach some English classes this weekend.

I accepted them to establish good will with my old employer, but as a result this weekend ended up being a little bit busier than expected.

In any case, I’m hoping to get a couple hours of programming in right now so that I can be prepared to be more effective at work tomorrow!

21:50 — I’m feeling a bit sharper with my HTML, CSS, React, and Materials UI skills. As far as Redux is concerned, however… I’m feeling pretty sketchy hahaha.

21:51 — I’ve just finished building a decent one page React “app”. It doesn’t have any real functionality, but at least my skills in putting together a React project from scratch and designing a layout from a prescribed design are better now.

21:52 — While I still need to get dinner with my girl, I’m hoping to do some Redux FreeCodeCamp exercises before bed so that at least I’m not clueless when trying to work with Redux tomorrow.

21:59 — Alright, not a lot of time, but let’s refresh on the basics of Redux. In Redux, there is a single state object that is responsible for the entire state of our application. This is called the Redux store.

We can create the Redux store with the createStore( ) method.

22:02 — All Redux methods are available from the Redux object. For example, we don’t create the Redux store by calling createStore( ). We actually would write Redux.createStore( )

22:05 — We can get the current state in the Redux store by using the getState( ) method.

22:09 — In Redux, all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions.

22:19 — I just installed the React-boilerplate and got it running on my computer. Don’t think I’m going to be able to do anything beyond this as it’s late and I have to commit this journal entry to GitHub, eat, dinner, shave, and still get 8 hours of sleep to be ready for tomorrow.
