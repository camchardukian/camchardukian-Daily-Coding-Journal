Pseudocode for resetting password

// Click setting gear icon

// Have the option to log out at the bottom of the screen in red text

// Logout

// At bottom of login page, there is text that states ‘forgot password?’

// If user clicks forgot password, they are prompted to enter their email.

// The email must be in the correct format (has @... and a dot)

// After user enters email and clicks submit, they are sent an email with a link that will allow them to reset their password

// After the user clicks on the password reset link in the email, they are asked to enter a new password

// The password needs at least 8 characters (with at least 1 uppercase and 1 lowercase letter)

23:16 -- Clearly it's been another busy day. I feel like I learned a lot today. While I'm far from where I need to be in order to be a productive member on my team, I feel motivated to bridge the gap whereas yesterday I felt discouraged.

I need to brush my teeth now, and get ready for bed. 

Here's to making tomorrow another productive day!
