23:12 -- While I'm slowly becoming less useless at work, I still have a LOOOOOOOOONG, LOOOOOOOONG, LOOOOONG way to go. With that being said, I'm fortunate enough to have a 3 day weekend now (with just 2 hours of English teaching each day).

That gives me plenty of time to improve my skills and make sure I can become more independent at work sooner rather than later.

23:13 -- Anyway, I'm tired. I'm going to commit this journal entry to GitHub and then get some sleep. Tomorrow I'll work on building some UI pages and using React-router to link between them.
