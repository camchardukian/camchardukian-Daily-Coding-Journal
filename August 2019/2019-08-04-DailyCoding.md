# Sunday August 4th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:24 — I did 1+ hour of coding today. I have’t coded at all the last week because this
last week I’ve been attending an intensive professional development course at my new company.

The course concluded last night and most of my classmates are going drinking or just
letting loose this weekend. I’m proud to have gotten some coding time in again today! :D

Today I spent some time learning about css grid and how to better build a responsive navbar.
Tomorrow I'll continue working on it, and hopefully write a journal entry that provides a
little bit more value hahaha ;)
