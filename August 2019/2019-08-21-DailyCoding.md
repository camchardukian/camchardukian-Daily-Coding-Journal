# Wednesday August 21st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:21 -- Today was my first day working as a software developer. When I got to the office, my "boss", one of the managers that hired me asked me to say hello to the developers on the Skype call.

I said hello, but had no idea who I was introducing myself to. I was also asked to introduce myself to the 50+ other developers in the office.

My boss also thought it would be a great way for me to connect with the locals on the team by introducing myself in Vietnamese. I agree!

Everyone at the office today was really supportive. 

Here is basically how my day went (with some stuff being censored to respect the company's privacy).

While I obviously can't tell you about the specifics of projects or names of employees/managers, I can't imagine speaking in generalities like learning about Git flow could hurt anyone and sharing this journal may be able to offer inspiration for future developers on their first day on the job.

20:41 -- As you can see, today was quite a busy day. I'm at dinner with my girl right now. The food just arrived. I'm going to eat, and then around 9 I'll put in a quick pomodoro to write some pseudocode about how I plan to tackle my first task tomorrow.
