# Friday August 23rd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

18:43 -- I'm about to study some stuff about Redux. Here's what my day at the office was like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Got water

Connected keyboard

Connected mouse

8:00 - 9:00
Scrum meeting

Continued working on forgot password page (focusing on figuring out how to prevent my CSS declarations from being overruled or alternative solutions to centering the button)

9:00 - 10:00

Finished centering the reset password button while maintaining relevant styles from Materials UI.

Learned about Material-UI’s styling solution.

Added proper margins and vertical spacing to layout.

10:00 - 11:00

Added back icon to layout

Refactored code to remove absolute positioning

Adjusted font sizes to be both equivalent to given design while also being responsive

Resized buttons for a more precise match to given design

11:00 - 11:45
End of sprint meeting

Bug fixing layout

Lunch

12:45 - 2:00
Added rectangle to bottom of layout and continued optimizing spacing.

2:00 - 3:00
Finished optimizing layout

Removed home rectangle as TEAM LEADER informed me that it’s unnecessary to include as the phone will include it by default.

Introduced to some of the basics of Saga with TEAM MEMBER

3:00 - 4:00
Caught up on Chatwork/emails

Completed official documentation redux-saga-beginner-tutorial

4:00 - 5:00
Discussed with TEAM LEADER more details about how Redux-saga works in the context of our project.

5:00 - 5:15
Prepared study materials for this weekend.
```
18:44 -- As you can see, today was another packed day of learning. Now, let's go sharpen our knowledge of Redux...

21:17 -- Just finished watching this [Redux analogy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sjMRS1gJys).

The author in this video basically uses the analogy of Redux being like an insurance company. 

While I recommend watching the video in full if you're struggling with Redux, he basically says that:

1. An **Action Creator** in Redux is like a customer/person dropping off a form at an insurance company.

1. An **Action** in Redux is like the form that's being dropped off.

1. **dispatch** is like the area or person that receives the forms.

1. **Reducers** are like the different departments in the company.

1. **State** is like the compiled data from all of the departments.

And finally, the Redux **Store** could be compared to the insurance company as a whole.

21:23 -- While just watching that video alone won't be enough to make me proficient in Redux, I do feel, however, that I now at least have a good idea of the different things I have available to work with in Redux.

21:30 -- It's getting late now. I want to eat, go home, maybe exercise or hang out with my girl for a little bit, and then get some sleep.

21:32 -- Tomorrow I'll try to build an application using React and Redux (probably a contacts list) to get more comfortable using Redux.
