# Wednesday August 14th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

13:22 -- My job at my new company hasn't been what I expected it was going to be. The workload has been far heavier than I thought it was going to be, and as I result I haven't been able to dedicate any real time to coding recently.

We're back now though. I'm going to try to build some momentum and get back into things by solving an algorithm on HackerRank.

13:24 -- I'm going to start by trying to solve the [Sherlock and Squares problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-squares/problem).

In this algorithm, we are given a starting and ending value of a range of integers. Our job is to find all of the square integers in that range.

In this problem, a square integer is defined as being the product of any integer squared. For example, 4 is the product of 2 squared. 9 is the product of 3 squared. 81 is the product of 9 squared. 100 is the product of 10 squared.

Just like last month, I'm going to attempt to solve this problem, and come back and explain my solution later.

Here's our basic problem setup:
```
function squares(a, b) {
  
}
```
13:32 -- Immediately, the first thing that comes to mind is that I'm going to want to create some type of function that calculates square numbers.

13:49 -- Here's the code I've put together thus far:
```
function squares(a, b) {
  let result = [];
  if (Math.sqrt(a) % 1 == 0) {
    console.log("it's a square root")
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < b; i++) {
    
  }
}

squares(100, 49)
```
13:50 -- As pathetic as it may sound, I'm absolutely exhausted after those last 25 minutes. I'm going to take the moral victory, get some exercise, take a nap, and try to solve the rest of this algorithm in another session or two later today.

While objectively I didn't make a ton of progress in this session, it did allow me to start to reactivate the "programming" and problem solving part of my brain again.

I'm hopeful the next session will be slightly less exhausting.
