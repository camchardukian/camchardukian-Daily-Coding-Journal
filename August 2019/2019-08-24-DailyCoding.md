# Saturday August 24th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

10:20 -- I'm now starting my first weekend as an employed developer. It's good to have a couple days "off" now after a jampacked first three days at my new job.

While I don't "have" to do anything today, I'm going to try to build a project with React and Redux today so that I'm more comfortable working with these technologies next week.

Let's go!

10:40 — I created a new React app. Now I’m installing Materials UI into my project…

10:46 — This is taking forever. I also think I need to update my nodeJS/npm version when I get a chance.

11:04 — I’ve now finished installing Materials UI into my React App, and now I’m just playing around and seeing what I can create.

Thus far I’ve worked on making sure the different imports and exports are linked up properly. I believe this is called injecting, but I’m not sure.

I’ve also added a Button from Materials UI, but I haven’t done much beyond that.

19:03 — Doing another quick pomodoro session. Thus far in this session, I just did a quick sketch of the page I’d like to design. Now I’m going to work on actually building it…

20:03 — I’ve legit spent 20-30 minutes trying to figure out why I can’t use my image in React. So frustrating. I’ve tried so many different paths but nothing works
<img className="image" src={'/Images/confused.jpg'} alt="confusedicon"/>
amongst countless other solutions.

Anyway, until I can figure out what is going wrong, I’ll just link to an external image so I can at least practice the rest of the design.

20:06 — Anyway, it’s getting late now. I think I’m going to get dinner and then I’ll probably get back at it again tomorrow, unless my girl and I return tonight unexpectedly soon.
