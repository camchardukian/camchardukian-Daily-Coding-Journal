Questions:
Is there a tool for seeing where a curly bracket's matching bracket is in large 500+ line files?
```
20:50 — And tonight I’ve spent the last 45 minutes updating my React project from last weekend and getting everything onto GitHub.

20:54 — If you put a star/asterisk at the end of the word function, it will become a generator function.

20:56 — We use the takeEvery() helper function if we want our code to run every time our event is dispatched. On the other hand, the takeLatest() function only runs a single time.

21:00 — Generators were introduced in ES6 can are sometimes referred to developers as pausable functions.

21:06 — URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. A URI is a string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet either by name, location, or both name and location. A URL identifies a resource by its location, and a URN identifies a resource by its name. That means that all URLs and URNs are in fact URIs.

21:16 — When a generator function reaches the keyword *yield*, the function will pause and wait for the thing being yielded on to get dealt with.

21:30 -- I've learned a lot about Redux and Redux-Saga today. With that being said, I'm still a looooong way from being anywhere near comfortable with either of these technologies. 

Of course, I'm sure the skills will come along if I just keep putting the time in.
