# Monday December 7th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:15 -- Like they say, "All good things come to an end." I think that's what is going to happen to this journal now.

I've logged how I've spent every hour of my life since February 2016. That's how I had such accurate hours counts for how many hours I'd spent programming, learning Vietnamese,exercising, well... pretty much everything.

I've spent the last 1.5+ years making my hour counts public on my software development journey as a kind of archive for others to see how many hours they may need to invest in order to become a solid developer.

I was always frustrated nobody could tell me a ballpark number for how long it would take for me to become a decent developer.

After logging my time for the last 5 years my hourly estimates are as follows:

~500 to get the very basics down (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS)

~1,000 to get an internship.

~1,500-2,000 to get one's first full-time job

~6,000-8,000 to become a mid-level developer

~10,000+ to become a senior developer

Not everyone will fall in line with these estimates. It depends on your study techniques, person aptitude, your location, the world economy, and more.

But at least these were the ballpark numbers I was looking for when I started my journey to become a software developer two years ago.

Unfortunately, the developers of the app I used for time logging designed their data transfer system poorly and I lost my time logs of the last several years while transferring them from my old phone to my new phone.

That of course is a big inconvenience in continuing this daily journal. I'd also thought for a while about how at this point I'm pretty much writing the same thing in this journal anyway, and that I'm probably already past the most useful point of this journal's life.

This journal's purpose was to help me establish the habit of coding everyday, and for me to learn GIT, and have something to put on my GitHub to land my first job.

Now that I've accomplished all of those goals, along with the deletion of my time logs... it seems like a natural place to draw this daily journal to a close.

I figured this day would come. After publicly showing my journey from 500 hours of my life invested in code to 3,700+ hours imagine anyone can get the gist of how long it takes to become a semi-competent coder.

If you're reading this, thanks for joining me on this journey over the last 1.5+ years. I'll still be coding everyday and building new projects.

I'm just no longer going to publicly document every minute I'm investing anymore for both practical, and privacy reasons.

If you're reading this in the future, feel free to go look at my past journal entries or reach out to me personally to see how I'm doing now.

Future me is looking forward to hearing from you. Cheers!
