# Wednesday December 2nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:05 -- Today was a nice day at the office. Today helped me regain some confidence (I've been dealing with imposter syndrome lately). Here's what I did:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Started making some improvements to the edit post flow

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:20
Division meeting

Finished making improvements to the edit post flow.

Optimizing flatlist configuration: https://reactnative.dev/docs/optimizing-flatlist-configuration

Notes:
If we forget to return inside of a switch statement itâ€™s possible to run multiple cases. Doing this inadvertently can cause unexpected behaviors such as a single action in Redux triggering multiple reducers.
```

21:07 -- After work I spent about 45 minutes continuing to improve my React Native Animated project.

I'm feeling pretty good about the code quality of my project now, but I'd like to get more comfortable explaining _how_ everything works as well as be able to argue _why_ certain design decisions were made.

We'll get to that tomorrow though. Good night.
