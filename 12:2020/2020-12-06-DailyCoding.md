# Sunday December 6th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:37 -- As is usual for a Sunday, I taught some English classes in the morning. After work I got Poke for lunch, took a nap, and then did about 1.5 hours of coding research and study before relaxing for the night.

My presentation on React Native Animated is this week and while I don't feel quite ready to present yet, I feel I came a long way this weekend.

In any case, it's late so I need to get some sleep. See you tomorrow.
