21:23 -- After work I also spent almost 1.5 hours continuing to research and prepare my presentation for my tech talk next week.

I'm excited to finish this presentation next week. It'll feel nice to have one less thing weighing on my shoulders and be able to get back to reading and doing exercises from _Eloquent JavaScript_.

With that being said, I'm going to call it a night here as I need to eat dinner and get ready for tomorrow. See you then.
