# Saturday December 5th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:53 -- Although I had some English classes I needed to teach this morning, I still had enough in the tank to put in a little over an hour of studying the React Native Animated docs today.

I'm going to continue putting in an hour everyday studying my demo app and the docs in order to make sure I'm ready to give a good presentation for my team this week.

For the immediate future, however, I just need a semi-decent night of sleep though. Let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow.
