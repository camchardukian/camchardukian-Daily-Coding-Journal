# Thursday January 23rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:08 -- Didn't do much code related stuff today. If I'm going to be perfectly honest, I was a bit lazy today. Sure, I did some more apartment cleaning and prepared for my trip to Malaysia, but if I was being a good executor like I normally am I would've got things done today.

Anyway, I'm exhausted. I'm going to try to get some rest, and then try to do at least a few hours of coding during my 1.5 week vacation.
