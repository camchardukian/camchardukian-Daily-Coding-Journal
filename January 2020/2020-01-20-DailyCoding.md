```

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:05

Researched debugging in React

Fixed some bugs in the React Native/TypeScript/Redux project but many bugs are still remaining.

Resources:

Notes:
```
21:01 -- I also spent about an hour after work doing some research to better understand the *useEffect* React Hook as well as destructuring in TypeScript.

I'm much more comfortable now with the useEffect hook than I was a couple hours ago.

However, I'm still struggling with safe destructuring in TypeScript (I understand JavaScript destructuring fine).

21:05 -- Let's regroup, and hustle hard again tomorrow.
