# Monday January 6th 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:19 -- Today was a fairly typical day at the office. Well, normal apart from the fact that I had my 6-month performance review, and also bought smoothies for everyone at the office (a company tradition I was honoring).

23:21 -- Anyway, here are my notes from today at the office:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Continued working on the admin student-list page

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 17:15
Annual review

Ordered drinks for coworkers

Finished working on the admin student-list page.

Notes:

We can use this syntax for creating history using React-Router: 

import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';
const history = createBrowserHistory();
```
23:23 -- Anyway, it's getting late now so I'm going to get to bed. See you tomorrow!
