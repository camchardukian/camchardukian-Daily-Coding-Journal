# Friday January 17th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:26 -- Today was a pretty good day at work. I got a TypeScript + Redux + React Native project up and running.

23:27 -- Here are my notes from the office today:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Started attempting to incorporate Redux into a React Native project with TypeScript.

OKR Meeting

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:05
Built a simple TypeScript, React Native, and Redux application

Created a Bitbucket repository for the above project so that other team members can learn from the project.

Resources:

Solution for solving error 65 (worth a shot anytime ‘react-native run-ios’ doesn’t work and the command line suggests you run things in XCode): https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25240

Flow types exported by React: https://flow.org/en/docs/react/types/#toc-react-node

useEffect React Hook tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4ni4uCUcvY

Hook documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html

Notes:
Typescript files that use JSX will have a .tsx extension while TypeScript files that do no use JSX will have a .ts extension.

The useEffect hook basically contains the functionality of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount all in one.
```
23:28 -- Tomorrow I just have to teach 2 hours of English rather than the normal 4 so maybe I'll finally get some weekend coding in again :D

Anyway, it's getting late now so I'm going to get to bed. See you tomorrow!
