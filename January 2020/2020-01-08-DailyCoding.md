# Wednesday January 8th 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:48 -- Today was one of the more difficult days I've had at work over the past few weeks. Here's what we got into today:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Refactored the code from the student-list page.

Continued working on the student detail page.


11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 17:35
Finished working on the student detail page.

Resources:

Notes:

We will encounter an error and our app will crash if we try to find the length of something thatâ€™s undefined.

Clsx is a tool used in React to construct conditional classNames.
```
22:05 -- Anyway, I'm feeling a bit tired now. Tomorrow should be easier as I expect I'll be working mostly on bug fixes rather than new features. Friday should also be a lighter day as we'll be doing a sprint review.

See you tomorrow!
