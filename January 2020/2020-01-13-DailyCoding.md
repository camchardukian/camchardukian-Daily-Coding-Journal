Here's what my day at work looked like today:

Caught up on Slack/email

Pair programming with senior developer to try to debug validation error bugs

Lunch/walk

12:45 - 17:25
Pair programming with senior developer to try to debug validation error bugs

Set-up a helloWorldApp in React-Native.

Notes:

It seems we need to request a credit card/company Apple account to download XCode and continue with the React-Native development.
```
21:11 -- It's crazy to think that there's just about 9 more days until I'm off for Chinese New Year.

I remember stressing when I first started working as a developer that if only I could make it to Chinese New Year that I'd be ok.

It's a little surreal to see that we're almost there :D
