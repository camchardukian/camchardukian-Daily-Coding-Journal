# Tuesday January 21st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:30 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Debugging the React Native, Redux, TypeScript app

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:00

Continued debugging/restructuring the React Native, Redux, TypeScript app

Resources:

Immer: https://www.npmjs.com/package/immer

Notes:

One of the biggest benefits of TypeScript is that using it provides more relevant intelliSense suggestions.

If our function has any optional parameters, they must always come after the required parameters (if there are any required parameters).
```
21:32 -- I spent most of the day debugging. As a result, today was a day that required a lot of patience.

By the end of the day, however, I can confidently say that I developed a stronger understanding of Redux from an architectural level.

I also has a conversation with a colleague that helped demonstrate to me the importance of the *immer* library and its role working with our reducers.

21:34 -- Now it's getting late. I can't believe tomorrow is the last day of work before Tet holiday (Chinese New Year)!
