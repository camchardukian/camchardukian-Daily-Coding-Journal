# Sunday January 19th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:30 -- Today I spent a couple hours teaching English, and an hour practicing Vietnamese. Most of the rest of the day I spent cleaning out my apartment to prep for an upcoming move.

23:32 -- Unfortunately, I didn't really touch any code today. I'll get back on the grind tomorrow.
