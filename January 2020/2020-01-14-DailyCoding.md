# Tuesday January 14th 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:16 -- Today was a pretty solid day at the office. Here's what I got into:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Did some administrative paperwork

Caught up on Slack/email

Installed Xcode

Talked with another team member to learn how to create API docs (I previously knew how to view and read API docs but not how to create them myself)

Got the iPhone simulator running on the computer

Built a basic ‘Hello World’ app.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:30
Made basic reusable React-Native components

Learned how to construct style sheets in React-Native

Learned about some of the React-Native components such as: [Alert, Image, View, Text, StyleSheet, etc.].

Built a basic one page application that incorporated state and used conditional rendering.

Notes:
When using remote Images in React-Native, we need to specify dimensions in order for said image to render. 

When using local image in React-Native, we need to require them within the source attribute of the image.

In order to use images in React-Native, we need to import the Image component from ‘react-native’.
```
22:17 -- Today was a lot of fun as I was able to download XCode, and get an iPhone emulator running on my computer.

I also built a basic application using React-Native and was able to test my application using the iPhone.

Some other members on my team are currently learning to write unit tests. I'm also hoping to learn how to write unit tests in the next couple months.

Getting the opportunity to learn so many new different skills is so exciting!

22:19 -- I also recorded a pretty cool vlog for the Daily Developer Show today. But... in any case, it's getting late so I'm going to get to bed now.

See you tomorrow!
