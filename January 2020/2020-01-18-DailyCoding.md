# Saturday January 18th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

16:25 -- I just finished a 50 minute coding session. During this session I:
* Built a rough draft of the rest of my React calculator's layout.
* Implemented a random number functionality into my calculator.
* Converted my calculator from a class to a functional component so that I could get some practice with the useState React hook.
