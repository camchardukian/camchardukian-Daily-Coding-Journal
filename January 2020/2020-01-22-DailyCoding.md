# Wednesday January 22nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:52 -- Today was a solid day of work. I can't believe it's finally time for Chinese New Year.

Without trying to sound too conceited, I of everyone at the company I'm working at deserves it.

I've been working two jobs for 5 months now. Today only 18 out of 50 tech workers came into the office.

Everyone else used PTO. I also think I was the only person in the office that actually worked today too.

Almost all of my coworkers watched YouTube videos or played chess because they mentally checked out yesterday.

Anyway, here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Implementing Redux-form into the React Native, TypeScript, Redux-Saga application.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:00

Implemented Redux-Form into the React Native, TypeScript, Redux-Saga application, found where the inputsâ€™ values were being stored, and dispatched the loginRequest action when the user pressed a button with the data they entered into the input forms.

```
23:56 -- Anyway, I'm exhausted. We'll talk more tomorrow.
