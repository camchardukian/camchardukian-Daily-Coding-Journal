# Thursday January 9th 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:15 -- Today was a solid day at the office. Here's what I got into:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Refactored the code from the student-list page.

Refactored code on the student detail PR.

Fixed the redirectUrl on the payment method page.

Fixed the company video modal validation, wrote a new Helper function to verify whether something is a valid url, and implemented improved error catching (to prevent the app from crashing when a user enters an invalid URL).

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 17:25
Fixed the phone number formatting and edited the regex rule to allow for both 10 and 11 digit phone numbers.

Worked on some data structure problems

Modified the route-content structure of our application, and added a number of global styles.

Started fixing a background-color problem in which a pageâ€™s background color is impacted by when it is visited, and whether the page is visited after a refresh, as well as some other UI bugs.

22:19 -- As you can see, I worked with a pretty wide variety of problems today. I also talked with my team lead, and I may get the opportunity to work with React Native in the coming months...
