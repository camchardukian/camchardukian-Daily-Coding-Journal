# Thursday January 2nd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:22 -- Today was a solid day. Here's what I got into at the office today:
```
8:30 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Performed some administrative tasks, and read JavaScript documentation.

Fixed some UI bugs.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 17:35
Familiarized myself with the basics of Ant Design.

Designed a login page for admin users.

The difference between rest parameters & the spread operator: https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/es6-spread-parameter-vs-rest-operator-5e3c924c4e1f

Notes:
Adding an empty string to something is an alternative way of converting something into a string.

While they both use ‘…’ syntax, rest parameters are used to collect all the remaining elements from an array or object, and package them into an array. On the other hand, the spread operator unpacks elements collected from an array or object into single elements.
```
20:24 -- I was a bit tired out today, but I still learned some good things. The most notable of which was probably getting some exposure to Ant Design, another front-end library for quickly building beautiful user interfaces.

Let's keep on grinding. See you tomorrow.
