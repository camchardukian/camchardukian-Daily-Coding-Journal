# Friday January 10th 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:09 -- Today was an interesting day at work. I spent most of it fixing bugs, attending meetings, and reading documentation about React-Native/setting up my development environment.

Unfortunately, due to a stomach ache, I went home 30 minutes early, and forgot to create a google docs recording my exact notes from today.

However, it seems I'll have an opportunity to work with React-Native sooner than I thought!

Anyway, it's been a long day so I'm going to get to bed now. See you tomorrow!
