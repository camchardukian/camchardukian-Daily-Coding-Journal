Notes:

PropTypes validation occurs at runtime while TypeScript type validation occurs when our code is compiling.

We can use the following syntax in TypeScript to check our variable for a 2-dimensional array of numbers…
const example: numbers[][]

In TypeScript we can use tuples to ensure our arrays are of a certain length and pattern. For example, if we want our array to have a length of 2, and be a number followed by a string, we could code things like so…
Const exampleTuple: [number, string] = [30, “hello”].

In TypeScript we can set return types to validate the data type of the value returned by our functions.

TypeScript types are public by default.

Question marks in TypeScript are used to denote optional variables.

Dynamically typed programming languages are those which do not know what types variables will be until run-time. JavaScript is an example of a dynamically typed language.
