# Friday January 3nd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:48 -- Today was a decent day at the office. I was quite tired, because I believe I've slept for less than 8 hours for 3 nights in a row.

With that being said, I still got some decent work done. Here's what the day at the office looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Refactored the admin login page code.

Started working on the admin student-list page

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 17:35
Continued working on the admin student-list page.

Notes:
```
21:50 -- Today I learned a bit about how to do pagination using the Ant Design library. I also just got a little bit more familiar with the library in general.

Beyond that, today I talked with some of my colleagues about Redux to develop a deeper understanding of injectReducer. 

While I do not yet have a deep level understanding about what injectReducer is doing, I have a semi-surface level of understanding of it, and can use it somewhat.

21:52 -- I'm going to try to start exercising more consistently again as I've felt a bit low energy lately. See you tomorrow!
