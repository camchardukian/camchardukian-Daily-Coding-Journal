# Saturday January 11th 2019 Daily Coding Journal

18:54 -- Today was a solid day of work. I spent the morning teaching English, did some marketing for one of my Youtube channels in the afternoon, and then spent 45 minutes or so setting up a setting up/designing some of the basic UI for a new React Project.

I'd like to build a couple React projects between now and the end of the Chinese New Year as my skills have improved dramatically since the last time I built personal projects.

Anyway, it was a long 55+ hour week of work so I'm going to shoot out now and get some exercise. See you tomorrow!
