# Saturday March 7th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:53 -- Today was mostly a recovery day. I spent about 5 minutes opening a new issue on my React calculator project, but aside from that I tried to relax after a really strenuous week at work.

We'll try to get a couple hours of coding in tomorrow to fix the last couple remaining issues in the React calculator.
