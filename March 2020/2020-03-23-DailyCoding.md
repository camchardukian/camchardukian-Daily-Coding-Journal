# Monday March 23rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:18 -- Today was a really solid day of coding. Here's how I spent my day at the office:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Finished React Native login page

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 18:25
Implemented logout into account settings, and finished account settings apart from 1 bug.
```
22:19 -- I spent nearly 9.5 focused hours coding today. And you know what's weird? I'm tired, but I'm not tired. Lately, I've felt a fire in me burning again similar to my first couple months working this job.

I want to get better, and I'm willing to put in the work to do so.
