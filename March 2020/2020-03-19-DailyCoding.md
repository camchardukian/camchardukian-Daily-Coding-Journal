# Thursday March 19th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:50 -- I spent a bit over 9 hours working on code related activities today.
While I'm still much better with React than with React Native, my mobile development skills are slowly coming along.

Anyway, here's what I did at the office today:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Resolved some TypeScript warnings in the React Native project.

Started working on the account settings page

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 18:15
Finished working on the account settings page except for Redux Persist.

Notes:

We can use alt + PrtScr to take a screenshot of a window on Ubuntu. That screenshot will 
then be saved in the pictures folder.

We can use “ctrl + shift + t” to reopen a closed tab on Ubuntu.
