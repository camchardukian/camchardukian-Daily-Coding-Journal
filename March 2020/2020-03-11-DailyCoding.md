21:32 -- Today was a decent day at the office. I developed a better understanding of how React Navigation work today as well as continued to get additional practice with React Native in general.

At this point, however, I must admit I still much prefer web development to mobile development.

In any case, however, I just try to show up everyday with a good attitude in that I'm going to leave the office in the evening a better developer than when I arrived in the morning, and I'm going to do everything I can to help my team succeed.

For now, that means getting a decent night of rest before getting back on the grind tomorrow. See you then :).
