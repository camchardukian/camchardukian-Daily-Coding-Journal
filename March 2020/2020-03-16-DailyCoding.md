an activity is in progress.

23:17 -- I feel like I'm getting better at independently learning new technologies (in today's case, Formik & Yup),
but that I still need to further improve in this area.

23:19 -- In any case, it's super late now. Time to get some sleep before another day of grinding tomorrow...
