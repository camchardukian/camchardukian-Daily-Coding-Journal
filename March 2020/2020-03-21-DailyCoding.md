# Saturday March 21st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

Note: I had a surprise visit from a friend yesterday so I'm writing this journal on Sunday. Yesterday I spent nearly 3 hours coding.

I fixed a bug with the decimal logic in my calculator and I also spent some time learning about [ref forwarding in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html).

Unfortunately, I'm still not quite sure how I'm going to implement keyboard functionality into my calculator. In any case, I do feel pretty good about spending nearly 3 hours coding on my "off day".
