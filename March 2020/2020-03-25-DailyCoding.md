Notes:
The web app manifest is a JSON file that tells the browser about how our progressive web 
App (PWA) should behave once installed on the user’s desktop or mobile device. This file 
typically contains information such as the app’s name, the icon the app should use, and which 
URL should be opened when the app is launched.

Kebab case refers to separating words of an identifier with hyphens (rather than uppercase
letters like camelCase)

22:53 -- I don't have much else to comment. I'm excited to finish this presentation and then continue building some side projects this week. Another 42 hours or so and we will have arrived to the promise land :D
