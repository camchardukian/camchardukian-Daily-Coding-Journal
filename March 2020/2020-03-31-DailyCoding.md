Notes:
```
23:31 -- I'm really productive working from home during work hours. One problem I've noticed, however, is after my 9 hours of work, my willpower reserves are pretty much gone and I feel fatigued.

As such, I want to transition to doing more productive/rejuvenating activities after work rather than just laying around wasting time doing mindless browsing/scrolling.

We'll think more about this tomorrow though as it's already quite late. See you tomorrow!
