# Wednesday March 4th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:17 -- Today was a decent day at the office. Here are my notes from today:
```
8:15 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Started working on the student profile creation flow

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:05

Finished most of the UI for step 1 of the student profile creation, started working on step 2.

Resources:

Notes:
We can auto-format code in Visual Studio Code on Mac using the command ‘alt + shift + f’.

It does not seem possible to change the height of a button element in React Native. If we need a higher level of customization over our buttons we can use the touchable opacity element.
```
21:21 -- Today I got a little bit of exercise in. I'm also making a conscious effort to get to sleep early tonight.

I'll try experimenting with these two variables to see what the optimal pairing between (exercise + wake time) while working my current position.

In any case, there's not much to add tonight. I've just been working with React Native all week. 

I'm getting somewhat comfortable with the basics of React Native, but I'm still feeling pretty shaky on how I'm going to implement some of the more advance features.

Anyway, I'm feeling pretty tired now so let's catch up more tomorrow. Have a good night! :D
