# Sunday March 29th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:02 -- Things didn't go exactly according to plan today. I had hoped to spend 2-4 hours working on one of my side projects today.

In the end, however, I only ended up spending about an hour working on it.

While I did make some forward progress, today definitely felt like a little bit of a let-down.

23:04 -- In any case, tomorrow I'll be working remotely for the first time. I'm a little bit nervous, but also very excited about the new things I'll learn from this experience! :D
