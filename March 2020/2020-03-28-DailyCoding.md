# Saturday March 28th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:03 -- Today was a pretty relaxed day. I spent about an hour coding today doing some pretty light UI work on the 1st FCC project.

I wasn't able to spend as much time coding as I would've liked, but I still got some time in after a long week.

Hopefully we'll be able to get more than an hour of coding in tomorrow though! :D
