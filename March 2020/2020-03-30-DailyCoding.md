# Monday March 30th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:40 -- Today was an interesting day. It was my first time ever working remotely as an employed software developer. Here's what my day at the office... errr house looked like:
```

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

Notes:

When you start working on a new task, you should always try to checkout to said branch
directly rather than creating a new branch. The reason for this is someone may have already
started working on your task on a remote branch, but if you create your own branch locally 
you may not know this, and you may waste time rewriting code they had already written.
```
22:41 -- While my task for today wasn't particularly complex, I did feel pretty proud that I was able to debug almost every issue I came across today while also being able to help one of our interns working remotely.

22:43 -- Hopefully tomorrow will go just as well as today did! :D
