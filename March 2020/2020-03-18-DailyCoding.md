22:29 -- While I certainly wish this whole Corona virus situation wasn't occuring, I'm going to try to make the most of this period of "social distancing", and try to focus on working extra hard in the coming weeks/months to become a better developer so that I can get through this difficult period, and truly thrive once this situation eases up a little.
