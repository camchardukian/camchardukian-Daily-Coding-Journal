# Monday March 2nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:59 -- Today was another average day at the office. Here's what I did:

Resources:

React Native SVG plugin: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-svg

React Native image documentation: https://reactnative.dev/docs/image.html#source
```
22:02 -- I had two main things I took away from today. The first is learning how to use images in React Native.

The previous application I built with an intern used Redux, and routing, but didn't actually include any images.

The other new thing I learned about today was [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/). While I haven't quite yet learned enough to architect a new application's routing, I now understand how to use an existing routing structure in an existing React Native app.

22:06 -- Hopefully we'll learn some more cool things tomorrow!
