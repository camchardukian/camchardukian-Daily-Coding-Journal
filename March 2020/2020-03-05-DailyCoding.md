# Thursday March 5th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:48 -- Today was an overall solid day of coding. At the office I spent a little over half of my time today working with React, and the other 30-40% working with React Native.

Here are my notes from the office:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Fixed some subscription dialog bugs

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:10
Fixed an auto-renewal UI bug

Continued working on the React Native student sign up/profile creation flow

Notes:
```
21:50 -- I also spent about 45 minutes or so this evening working on my React Hook/Context calculator. It's nearing completion I think and I expect it to be finished in the next week or so! :D

21:51 -- Finally, it's time to get some dinner, and relax for the night. See you tomorrow!
