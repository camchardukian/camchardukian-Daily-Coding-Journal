# Monday March 9th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:49 -- Today was a fairly forgettable day. I went in to work a couple hours late this morning as I had a pretty bad headache.

I spent pretty much the entire rest of the day learning the different keyboard shortcuts with windows, installing and configuring different applications, and installing ubuntu.

In other words, not the most exciting day. It was nice to get used to a dual monitor setup for the first time as a developer, however. Anyway, it's getting late now.

See you tomorrow!
