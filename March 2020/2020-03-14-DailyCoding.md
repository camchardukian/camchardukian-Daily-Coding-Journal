# Saturday March 14th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:13 -- I spent a little over an hour working on code related things today. I created some an issue for a new bug I discovered in my React Hook Calculator.

I also finished implementing the logic for the calculator's exponent button. Tomorrow I may try to close the last open issue for the calculator (and hopefully find that no new bugs arise in the process!).

Or, perhaps I'll spend some time learning about [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/).

I'm still undecided. Either way, I'll strive to continue perfecting my craft tomorrow! :D
