21:10 -- I'm starting to get somewhat comfortable with Ubuntu, but I still prefer working on MacOS. I spent most of today continuing to work in React Native.

I think I'll make some solid strides forward with React Native in the coming weeks as a colleague and I are hoping to do a presentation on React Native for the rest of the developers within the next several weeks.

We're lucky in the fact that a senior developer with a few years of React Native experience just joined our team.

We'll see how things develop these next couple weeks...
