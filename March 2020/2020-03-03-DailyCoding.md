# Tuesday March 3rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:56 -- Today was a solid day at the office. I learned a lot about how to  take designs off of Zeplin and convert them into React Native code.

This is to be expected given that it was by first time I took an existing design and tried to build it using React Native.

Anyway, here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Continued working on student signup React Native/TypeScript

Setup React Native Debugger

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:05
Continued working on student signup React Native/TypeScript

Resources:
React Native Scroll View Documentation: https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview

Notes:
Using FlatLists instead of ScrollViews can sometimes offer better performance if we are rendering a very long list of items due to the fact that FlatLists render items lazily, meaning that items are only rendered when they are about to appear and items that are way off screen are removed to save memory and processing time.

Buttons in React Native do not seem to have a dedicated style prop.  For that reason, we may need to rely on containers for our buttons in order to style the width and most of the other properties of the button.

Cmd + alt + s === save all files in VisualStudio Code on Mac.
```
23:58 -- I've been doing a great job at the office lately. My only problem is feeling really tired when I get home from work. I'll try to exercise more to address this in the coming days.
