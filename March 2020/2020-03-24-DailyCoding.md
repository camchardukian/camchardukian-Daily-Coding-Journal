# Tuesday March 24th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:20 -- Today was a pretty dull day. Here's how I spent the day at the office:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Prepared slides for Tech Talk on React Native

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:15

Continued researching and preparing for the React Native Tech Talk

Resources:

Notes:
```
23:22 -- As you can see, I spent the entire day preparing slides, and doing research so that I'm able to make an impactful presentation to my colleagues on React Native.

23:23 -- While I did learn some things today about Progressive Web Apps, Flutter,and the Iconic framework, I **STRONGLY** prefer writing code over writing reports.

Even with that being the case, I spent an extra hour or so when I came home tonight studying some technical topics so that I'm able to be a more eloquent speaker when I give this presentation.

In any case, it's getting late now so I'm going to get to sleep.

See you tomorrow!
