# Friday March 20th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:18 -- Today was a pretty solid day at the office. Here's how I spent the day:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Read documentation on Redux Persist

Fixed bug where a number of chained persists prevented the currentUser from ever being 
given an initial load into the Redux Store. 

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 18:20
Nearly finished login/account settings flow

React-Redux Hooks: https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks

Notes:
In Redux Persist, PersistGate prevents the rendering of our appâ€™s UI until the persisted state 
has been retrieved and saved to Redux.

React-Redux hooks were created to allow us to connect our components to the react-redux 
Store without the need for HOCs (higher order components). 
```
22:19 -- As you can see I learned about a lot of great stuff today. Most notably, a basic understanding of Redux Persist, as well as a more detailed understanding of React-Redux hooks.

I finished the day a better developer than when I started it. That in my eyes, makes today a success.
