# Friday March 27th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:28 -- Well, we're finally past the Tech Talk! We had a passable presentation, but I was a disappointed that some of my humurous parts did not land as well as I thought they would.

I chalk that up to a mixture of the language barrier, and perhaps the fact that this is a bit of a tense time in the world right now.

In any case, here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
9:00 - 11:45
Caught up on Slack/email

End-of-sprint meeting

Continued researching and preparing for React Native Tech Talk

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:30
Gave React Native Tech Talk

OKR Meeting

Researched React Fiber

Notes:
React Native version 0.62 was released on March 26th 2020.

Scheduling is the process of determining when work should be performed.

Work is any computations that need to be performed, usually as a result of some update.

A fiber can be defined as “one unit” of work.

A push-based approach is the idea that you “the programmer” should decide how work should
be scheduled.

The main idea of React Fiber is that it uses a pull-based approach to intelligently make 
decisions for us on how to schedule work.

Reconciliation is the algorithm React uses to differentiate one DOM tree from another.

Several years ago, React did not take advantage of scheduling. This was the primary motivation for the creation of React Fiber.

Fiber enabled React to take advantage of scheduling by allowing it to pause work and come back to it later, assign priority to different types of work, reuse previously completed work, and abort work if it’s no longer needed.
```
22:33 -- I'll try to work on and push through the first project or two in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum this weekend.

See you tomorrow!
