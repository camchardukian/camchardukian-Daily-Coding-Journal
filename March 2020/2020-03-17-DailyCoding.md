# Tuesday March 17th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

20:00 -- Today was a somewhat frustrating day at the office due to a number of difficult to diagnose bugs in our React Native project.
Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Debugging environment problems on Korec Android

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:25
Continued working on login page refactoring.

Resources:
React Native getting started: https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started

Unable to resolve module `path` from `node_modules/@babel/core/lib/config/item.js`: path could not be found within the project: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/27522
 
Building and validating forms with React Native using Formik and Yup:

Notes:
Many React Native developers feel Genymotion is the best Android emulator.
```
20:03 -- I think I'm starting to get somewhat better at diagnosing common errors that lead to an app not being able to start (modules that cannot be resolved, improperly set up environments, etc).

I have a good feeling tomorrow will be a day of great forward progress at work. Hopefully we can make it so! :D
