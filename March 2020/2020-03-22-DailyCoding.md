# Sunday March 22nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:38 -- Today was another pretty decent day of coding. I implemented keyboard functionality into my React Hook calculator, but further improvements are still needed.

I'm not quite sure why, but for some reason after the user presses around 6-8 keys on the keyboard, my app eventually gets sent into an infinity loop.

So, we're making progress, but our app still isn't where it needs to be yet.

Today I also started a new project. I decided I'm going to try to go and make all of the FreeCodeCamp front-end library projects. I don't expect this to take too long as it looks like according to FreeCodeCamp the calculator is the 4th most difficult of the 5 projects (based on the sequence we're recommended to build the projects in).

In any case, I'm just going to keep putting in the hours to better myself to create a better future for myself and my loved ones.
