Notes:
If installing something with NPM or yarn breaks our application and trying to remove said package fails to fix our app, the best possible solution at that point may be to look at the node_modules/package.json from the most recent functioning commit.
```
23:44 -- Working on React Native all week has been really mentally straining. Not only is a lot of the syntax different, I'm also developing a fairly complex feature and trying to do so while not yet previously having had the opportunity to accumulate any experience doing mobile development.

In other words, this week was a huge learning experience. I'm certainly grateful for all the things I've learned, but your boy is tired now.

Time to get some rest!
