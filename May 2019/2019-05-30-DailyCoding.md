# Thursday May 30th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

10:44 -- I went to sleep at about 3:30am. Right now I'm running on about 5.5 hours of sleep. It's not ideal, but I'm trying to get out of my week-long habit of staying up until 3am each day. Anyway, on to FreeCodeCamp we go!

10:47 -- 
>"The way to override the default props [(that you've set in React)] is to explicitly set the prop values for a component." -- FreeCodeCamp

Seems reasonable enough.

10:53 -- Check it out, here's some good information. In React we have access to something called type-checking features.

These allow us to mandate that the data of our prop be of only a specific type.

For example, if we know an API call should retrieve data in the form of an array we can require our component to only accept said data if it is in the form of an array.

If the data is of any other type, it will be rejected.

11:03 -- It looks like when using ES6 class components we may need to use the *this* keyword when accessing props, whereas appears to be unnecessary when accessing props in functional components.

11:08 -- SO tired lol. I'm going to commit this to GitHub and then take a mini nap at this convenience store.

I WILL NOT leave the convenience store because that would make it too easy to stop coding.

When my nap is finished I'll continue coding.
