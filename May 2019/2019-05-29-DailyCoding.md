# Wednesday May 29th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

1:13 -- It's the start of another day, and another daily coding journal entry! As you may recall, I spent yesterday building a meme generator using React. If you're looking for that project, you can [find it on GitHub here](https://github.com/camchardukian/ReactProjects/tree/master/meme-generator).

1:21 -- I just spent a couple minutes updating my README file for this project on GitHub. Now, let's finish watching the capstone video, and take notes on how Bob developed his application differently than I did.

1:25 -- While he structured his code a little differently, Bob and I used essentially the same logic in executing the final step in the capstone project.

1:27 -- One interesting thing to note I observed when playing with the code, however, is that if one puts the onSubmit event handler on the form element, we can prevent the default submit from occuring using:

> event.preventDefault()

If we put the same onSubmit event handler on our button, however, the above code snippet does not seem to work.

1:31 -- Now we're going to watch a video on ["Writing Modern React Apps"](https://scrimba.com/p/p7P5Hd/cvDkySN). The first time I'll watch this video all the way through. The second time through I'll stop and take notes throughout.

1:36 -- The video basically just talked about the fact that React is advancing very quickly due to the fact that it is constantly being worked on by Facebook developers and the open source community.

The video also provides some links for recommended reading.

1:42 -- It's official, I've finally finished the *Learn React for Free* course!
I'm going to take a quick break and then I might just still be motivated enough for another coding session!
