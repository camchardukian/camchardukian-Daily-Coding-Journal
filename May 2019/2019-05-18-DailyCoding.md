13:58 -- We're off to a bit of a late start today due to other obligations, but no worries. We're still going to execute and put our time in.

14:02 -- When a functional component is rerendered, it basically means simply that the functional component will run (or be called) again.

14:05 -- The essence of conditional rendering is that we choose whether to render something or what to render to the screen based on if some condition evaluates to true.

14:08 -- A little more than halfway through [the video](https://scrimba.com/p/p7P5Hd/c4kJNSL) Bob Ziroll explains that it's a very common practice to use ternary operators with conditonal rendering.

14:12 -- Remember that if something is nested within a JSX element and we want that nexted something to be interpreted as JavaScript (rather than JSX), it's crucial for us to remember to enclose our JavaScript inside of curly braces.

14:14 -- Something to keep in mind is that we don't have to render all of our page simultaneously. In fact, I'd argue that most of the elements on an average webpage are static with only one or a few elements reliant on conditional rendering (if any).

14:18 -- It was an early morning so I'm feeling pretty drowsy now. I'm going to take a nap and maybe practice writing code by hand,and/or building the tutorial application from scratch when I come back.
