# Tuesday May 21st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

0:56 -- It's officially Tuesday! Close to 1am... Let's dooooo it!

0:57 -- The following notes are from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwyoVjVXnLk) on promises.

1:03 -- In order to make a new promise, you need to provide a path for that promise to be either resolved or rejected.

1:08 -- We can pass the argument/method/keyword (I'm not sure of the right terminology) new Error to our reject method. Example:
```
reject(newError("The API call was unsuccessful. Please try again."))
```

1:14 -- I just finished watching Part II on promises. 

1:15 -- Next I'm going to watch and take notes on Coding Train's two part series on [async and await in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO77Fib9tSI).

1:20 -- If a function returns a promise, you can use the *await* keyword which has something to do with having some promise resolve (Clearly I do not yet understand the await keyword).

1:22 -- The *await* keyword is only usable within the context of an asynchronous function.

1:24 -- It seems there is a keyword called *async* that can be added before a function is declared and that will modify said function to be asynchronous.

1:35 -- It looks like combining the use of async and await we can write code that is easier to read than if we were to chain a bunch of .then() functions. 

Having been [introduced in ES8](https://hackernoon.com/es8-was-released-and-here-are-its-main-new-features-ee9c394adf66), await and async may not be supported in ALL versions of all browsers, but given that they've been out for two years already, it would be advisable to start getting comfortable with them if you aren't already.

1:40 -- It's pretty late now so I'm going to get to bed. In the morning I'll start learning about promise.all in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01RTj1MWec0). I'll probably also start to watch Dylan Israel's videos on Scrimba about async and await. See you then!
