# Saturday May 25th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

12:28 -- Just finished 4 hours of hustling, now let's get some coding in.

12:31 -- I'm going to rewatch the forms part II tutorial on Scrimba and then write the code from the video by hand.

12:43 -- I'm tired because I started hustling early this morning, but I'm going to write all of the code from the video at least once to get my brain processing everything and start establishing some muscle memory regarding forms.

12:58 -- MAN that was a ton of writing. Over 100 lines of code lol. Anyway, when I come back I'll try to recreate the instructor's forms from scratch. See ya later!
