# Thursday July 2nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:21 -- Today was a solid day of work. Here's what I did:

Notes:
```

I also spent about 2 hours working on my pomodoro clock after work. My pomodoro clock now seems to function adequately from an outside perspective, but only 25/29 unit tests from FreeCodeCamp pass so there's clearly still some internal improvements that need to be made.

Hopefully we can finish those up this weekend.

For now, however... good night! :D
