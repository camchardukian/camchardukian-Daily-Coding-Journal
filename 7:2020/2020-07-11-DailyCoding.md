# Saturday July 11th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:10 -- I didn't spent a whole lot of time coding today, but I did have one decent study session where I learned more about middleware functions in node/express and continued to progress through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

Here are my notes from this evening's study session:

- Middleware functions usually add information to the request or response objects.

- Middleware functions take 3 arguments:
  - The request object
  - The response object
  - The next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle

I feel [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIr1oxQ3pao) is a great supplementary resource to go through while completing these FCC exercises.

23:13 -- We'll try to keep up the daily momentum tomorrow. See you then.
