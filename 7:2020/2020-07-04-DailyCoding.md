# Saturday July 4th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:28 -- Today was a relatively light day of work. I spent about 4.5 hours teaching English this morning, and another 20-30 minutes tidying up my GitHub and doing other light coding activities in the afternoon.

I also spent about an hour or so posting my new FreeCodeCamp certificate to social media platforms, and talking with one of my friends in tech back in the US.

While today was mostly a breather, I hope to get right back to work bettering my skills as a software developer tomorrow as I start working on the FreeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices coursework.

For now, however, let's enjoy ourselves, get some rest, and get back on the grind tomorrow! :D
