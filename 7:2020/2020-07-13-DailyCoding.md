22:29 -- After work, I also spent an hour or so finishing up the basic Node and Express challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Today I learned mostly about how to use the _body-parser_ library as a middleware to parse the request data from _POST_ requests.

22:33 -- In the coming days I'll start learning about the basics of Mongo using FreeCodeCamp. Well, that's about all I have to say for today. See you tomorrow!
