23:22 -- After work I also spent an additional 30 minutes or so continuing to go through the MongoDB and Mongoose FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I'm guessing I'll finish the MongoDB and Mongoose section either tomorrow or Sunday.

And then... it'll be project time!

While that is very exciting, so is the prospect of a decent night's sleep.

I have another day of work tomorrow morning so it's time to call it a night. See you tomorrow!
