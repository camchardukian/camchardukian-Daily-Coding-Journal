23:14 -- After work, I finished my pomodoro clock. You can see the [live demo here](https://camchardukian.github.io/fcc-react-typescript-pomodoro-clock/). As a result, I was able to claim [my FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/camchardukian/front-end-libraries)! :D

I've wanted to earn this certification for over a year now so I'm excited to have finally done it. Next up...
The API and Microservices certification!

But before that, let's get a little bit of sleep and find something small to treat ourselves this weekend :D

Maybe a couple kilograms of blueberries, maybe a short weekend trip next month I'm not sure.

In any case, I'm super proud to have earned this certificate! Let's enjoy this moment! :D
