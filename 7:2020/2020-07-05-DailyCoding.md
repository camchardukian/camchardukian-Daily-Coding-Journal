# Sunday July 5th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

18:12 -- I've decided that today will be the day I start working on the FreeCodeCamp _APIs and Microservices_ coursework.

I started with the coursework about 30 minutes ago. The challenges for back end are completely different than the challenges for front end.

While I'm pretty comfortable using NPM, I have not yet assumulated much knowledge about how to write server side code.

While these initial challenges are simply (such as changing the author of the application in the package.json file), FreeCodeCamp suggests either cloning their repository or following along with the challenges on glitch.com.

I've never used [glitch](https://glitch.com/), and I also don't really understand yet how the unit tests will run and check my code if I clone the repo and run it on my local machine.

For that reason, I spent about 30-40 minutes watching [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl1inp6ycdI) that basically served as an introduction to glitch.com as well as a surface level tutorial of how to create an endpoint, an event listener, and and how to make an _XMLHttpRequest_ using Vanilla JavaScript.

While I definitely could not immediately replicate the code in the above tutorial, I understood most of the things the instructor taught us about -- at least on a surface level.

21:19 -- I'm going through the _Managing Packages with Npm_ challenges right now. They're pretty simple. You just make a small change to the existing project on Glitch.

After that, you can then can copy a link to your live app, and paste it into the FCC challenge page. The unit tests are then able to execute and confirm you

Here are some things I noted while going through the challenges:

- Inside of our package.json there is a field called the _description_ field that can be used to help others quickly understand your project.
- There is also another field called the _keywords_ field that we can give a value of an array of strings that describe our project via keywords.
- The _license_ field tells users what they are allowed to do with your project.
- Npm packages follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer).
- Here's a nice definition of SemVer from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/) is a 3-component number in the format of X.Y.Z where:
  - X stands for a major version.
  - Y stands for a minor version.
  - Z stands for a patch.

23:11 -- Today was a pretty solid day. I spent about 4.5 hours teaching English this morning as my side hustle. After that, I spent a little over 1.5 hours learning about glitch, npm, express, and the backend JavaScript ecosystem in general.

Tomorrow I'll finish the managing packages section of the curriculum, and move on to what looks like the node/express section.

See you then!
