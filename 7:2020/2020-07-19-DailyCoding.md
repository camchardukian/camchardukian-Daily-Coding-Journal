# Sunday July 19th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:21 -- Today was a pretty solid day. I spent 4.5 hours teaching English in the morning as my side hustle.

In the evening I finished the FreeCodeCamp MongoSB and Mongoose curriculum. I also finished reading and taking notes on chapter four of _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_.

22:23 -- Now, I'm going to get some dinner, and get ready for bed. I feel pretty ready for another week at the office trying to contribute to my team and improve my skills.
