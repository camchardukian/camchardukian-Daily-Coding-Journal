21:17 -- I'm still dealing with some issues that came up in my personal life. While sunk costs are sunk costs, I'm still trying to recover emotionally as feeling bad about myself cannot repair the damages that have already been done.

In any case, while my head isn't in the right place yet and I'm still very fatigued, it was good to get back to work and chat with my coworkers again.
