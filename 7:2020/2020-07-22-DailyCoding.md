Notes:
We can include multiple format arguments to momentJsâ€™s format method. For example, we can
write:

moment(_.get(data,'createdAt')).format('LL HH:mm:ss');
```

23:25 -- After work I also spent about 50 minutes or so continuing to work through the FCC backend curriculum.

I'm getting pretty close to finishing the first project (a Timestamp Microservice).

23:26 -- Anyway, I'm absolutely exhausted. It's time to get to bed. See you tomorrow.
