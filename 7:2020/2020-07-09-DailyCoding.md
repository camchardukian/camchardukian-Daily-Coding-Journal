# Thursday July 9th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:40 -- Today was a long day of coding. Here's what I did at the office:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Added video thumbnails from the server

Worked with a couple teammates to fix a problem with the student signup process

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:10
Finished working on adding video thumbnails from the server in the edit profile and the profile
create screens.

Notes:

23:41 -- After work I also spent a few hours working on the FreeCodeCamp Node and Express challenges. Here's some of the notes I took while doing them:

```
In express we put middleware functions inside of *app.use()*.

app.use() takes two arguments. The first is an optional *path* argument. If no path is provided, the middleware will be executed for all requests.

The second argument is the middleware function itself.

We can use the express.static(path) middleware function to serve static assets like .png or css files.

REST stands for (Representational State Transfer). REST APIs allow for data exchange in a simple manner without the client side having to know any details about the server.

Here’s a [pretty simple video I watched to better understand the basics of REST APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA
).

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIhGddkSMpU) was great for learning how to return JSON from an API call.

I’m now working on [a FreeCodeCampe exercise about .env files](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/basic-node-and-express/use-the--env-file).
```

23:42 -- Either tomorrow or Saturday I'll shoot to finish the rest of the Node and Express challenges.

For now, let's get some rest and try to do great work tomorrow.
