# Tuesday July 14th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:26 -- Today was a better day at the office than most of the previous several days. Here's what I did today:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Finished working on the job title, search, and filter

Fixed a UI bug on the company image lightbox

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:30
Reviewed Postman documentation

Worked on debugging the errors for when questions are deleted while the student is in
the process of deleting them.

Resources:
Postman sending requests documentation:
https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/

Notes:
Visual Studio Code has a shortcut (ctr + k + w) to close all of the open editors.
```

After work I also started working on the MongoDB and Mongoose challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

Here area a couple new things I learned today:

- Mongo uses JSON as its document storage structure.
- Mongoose.js is an nom module that can make it easier for us to construct documents for storage in Mongo.

I also created a new database using MongoDB Atlas, and cloned/remixed a project on Glitch to complete the FCC MongoDB and Mongoose challenges this week.

I didn't however finish connecting my database to my application on Glitch. But... that's what I'll start with tomorrow after work! :D
