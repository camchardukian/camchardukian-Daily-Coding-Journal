23:20 -- Unfortunately, I procrastinated after work and didn't get around to doing any additional coding study. I think I'm starting to get a bit burnt out. I've been working several months without any days off,and I haven't had a vacation in almost 6 months.

I may need to take some time off this summer to recharge before hitting the rest of 2020 hard.

I guess the other possible explanation is just that the tasks I've been working on this week have been difficult, thus my willpower and energy has been pretty much drained each day by my full-time employment.

In any case, we'll try to figure things out soon. Let's get some rest. See you tomorrow.
