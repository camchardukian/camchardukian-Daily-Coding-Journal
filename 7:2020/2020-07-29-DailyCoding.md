# Wednesday July 29th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:40 -- Today I had to deal with some issues in my personal life so unfortunately I couldn't
dedicate any time to coding.

Tomorrow I think I'll get some coding time in, but there are some issues going on in my life right now that are quite serious so I probably won't be back to my normal self for another week or two.
