# Tuesday July 21st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:31 -- Today was a solid day. Here's what I did at the office:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Cloned and debugged errors when trying to run the new React Native project

Started learning a bit about the basic flow of the new project, as well as allocating some time
to study the projectâ€™s Miro, and other documents.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:35
Started working on the booking history feature

Resources:
React Native Animated: https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated

UML: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language

Notes:
It is possible to have read-only access to a Parse Server database.
```

23:33 -- After work, I also spent an additional hour on my professional with that hour split between working on a time parser API project using Node and Express on one hand, and continuing to read _*Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby*_.

While I was working on my time parser project, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvRFRPkyd3M) really useful for understanding unix timestamps.

23:35 -- In any case, I'm still not fully myself. I found myself getting fatigued quite easily today.

Hopefully, getting some rest now will help me feel less tired tomorrow.
