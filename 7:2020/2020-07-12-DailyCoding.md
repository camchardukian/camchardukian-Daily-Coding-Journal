# Sunday July 12th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:41 -- Today was a decent day. I spent about 4.5 hours teaching English this morning, and then about 50 minutes or so tonight continuing with the FreeCodeCamp Node and Express exercises.

Here are some of the topics I worked on today:

- Mounted/Chained middleware
- Route parameters
- Query parameters from the client

Anyway, now it's late and I need to work in the morning. See you tomorrow!
