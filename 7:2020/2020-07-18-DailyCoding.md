# Saturday July 18th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:19 -- Today was a decent day. I spent about 4 hours teaching English in the morning, and about 40 or so minutes continuing with the MongoDB and Mongoose challenges on FreeCodeCamp in the evening.

Tomorrow I'll finish the final challenge for this section of the FCC curriculum and then we'll get started with the projects!

Exciting!

Now, however, I'm pretty tired. Time to get some rest. See you tomorrow!
