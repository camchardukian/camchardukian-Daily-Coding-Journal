23:48 -- After work I also spent about an hour working on my pomodoro clock. My pomodoro clock now makes a sound whenever the time reaches _"0:00"_. I can't wait to keep working on the pomodoro clock, finish it, get the front end libraries certification, and then start working on the API and microservices certification! :D
