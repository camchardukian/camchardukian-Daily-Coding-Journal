# Saturday September 28th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:55 -- Today was a pretty uneventful day as far as programming is concerned. I took the day off (of programming, I still had to teach 2 hours of English classes for short-term cash) to focus on some other things in my life.

23:57 -- Tomorrow I'll try to do some research on axios post, form data, and the react-image-crop library to prepare for my task at work next week. See you then!
