# Sunday September 22nd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

18:34 — Here we go. Yesterday and today I taught a couple English classes. Unfortunately, if I want to keep myself in solid financial shape, I’m probably going to need to continue teaching these classes for the remainder of 2019.

I guess I could just live *very* frugally, but this is probably the more practical approach. In any case, today I’m continuing with the Postman video series.

18:37 — Today we’re starting with [video 8 in Raghav’s Postman video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gGHnnBWQY8&list=PLhW3qG5bs-L-oT0GenwPLcJAPD_SiFK3C&index=8&pbjreload=10). Here are my notes:

—When we have a large number of APIs with a large number go variables, creating different environments (such as development, QA, production, etc) is something most organizations will do because each environment will require different values for things like URLs, Usernames, Passwords, etc.

In other words, creating different environments allows us to easily test our APIs under different conditions by a variety of user groups, without having to manually change our variables each time.

18:49 — Here are my notes for [video 9 in Raghav’s Postman video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qtS_TLVF4&list=PLhW3qG5bs-L-oT0GenwPLcJAPD_SiFK3C&index=9):  

— Pre-request scripts are run before sending our API request to the server.

— Test scripts are run after we receive a response from the server.

— We can create scripts at the environment, folder, or request level.

18:55 — I just finished my 2nd video of the day. I’m going to take a quick 5 minute break, and then take notes on a couple more videos.

19:01 — I’m back. Here are my notes for [video 10 in Raghav’s Postman video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_mEuR-aGEY&list=PLhW3qG5bs-L-oT0GenwPLcJAPD_SiFK3C&index=10):

— Postman tests are blocks of JavaScript code that are executed after we receive a response from the API.

— Postman has pre-made snippets of JavaScript that can test different things without us even needing to write our own tests! Well… without needing to write or own code in basic cases at least… :p

19:11 — Here are my notes for [video 11 in Raghav’s Postman video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1RsYcgkSY&list=PLhW3qG5bs-L-oT0GenwPLcJAPD_SiFK3C&index=11):

— On Mac, we can open the Postman console using *alt + cmd + c*.

— Some of the things logged to the console include: the output of our scripts, our requests, the responses to our requests, as well as our variables and the values that they currently hold.

— There are several methods we can use to print things to the console. We can use *console.log()*, *console.info()*, *console.warn()*, or *console.error()*.

19:19 — This wasn’t a long coding session, but I’m trying to be consistent. My body literally feels like it’s overheating right now, especially my forehead. I’m not sure what’s up, but I’m going to go for a walk. Maybe I’ve just been sitting too much lately…

In any case, it was good to continue this Postman course. I feel like I’m learning some new tool almost every week for my developer job.

I’m going to commit this journal entry to GitHub, and then take care of myself to get ready for tomorrow.
