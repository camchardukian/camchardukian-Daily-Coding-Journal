# Monday September 2nd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

9:50 — It’s a holiday but I’m on the grind! Let’s get some more React-router practice in.

10:02 — I’ve been struck with inspiration. I’m going to use React-router to build a haunted house choose your own adventure app!

10:03 — In React, functional component lack state and lifecycle methods. For that reason, functional components are commonly referred to as stateless components.

10:51 — I’ve gotten a basic homepage printed out with a haunted house image, some headlines, a couple buttons, and some basic (though quite ugly) CSS styles.

11:02 — Added some “Links” to the buttons as well as imported { Link } from react-router-dom.

11:03 — I’m going to head out of this coffee shop now. More changes coming soon.

11:37 — Just walked around a bit.

23:14 -- My work with React-router was pretty repetitive today. As a result, I didn't take too many notes. With that being said, today I definitely got more comfortable with file paths, importing/exporting, React/react-router syntax and so forth.

23:15 -- I pretty much finished my haunted house application. I need to tweak the CSS styling a little bit to make the buttons look better on different screen sizes. Overall, however, I'm happy with how it turned out.

This application was pretty easy to develop, but it did give me a lot of repetition to improve my React fundamentals and also strengthen my knowledge of react-router.

Tomorrow I'll be back to my programming office job. I'm sure I'll have lots to report about tomorrow night!
