# Wednesday September 25th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:59 -- Today was a decent day at the office. Here's what things looked like for me:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 10:30
Scrum meeting.

Made pull requests for block connections and remove connections features.

10:30 - 11:00
Assigned new task and discussed requirements with QA

11:00 - 11:45
Started working on bug fix about login UI.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 4:00
Finished fixing login UI bug, made PR, then finished another task about fixing a bug regarding password validation and the UI for said page.

4:00 - 5:00
Starting working on bug fix for edit user settings page.

Notes:
If you want to use an onClick event handler with a <div> tag, you need to assign the <div> tag a role of presentation.

Hereâ€™s some example code:

<div className="back-drop" role="presentation" onClick={() => this.closeSlideUpModal()} />
```
23:02 -- After work, I focused on taking care of my body. I took a nap for an hour, walked a few kilometers, and spent an hour or so juggling.

Now, I'm going to eat some mangoes and then get to sleep.

Today was mostly about fixing small bugs at the office and making small optimizations to existing pieces of code.

Tomorrow my team leader will be back (he was off today), so I expect I may have some new task.

In any case, let's prepare for tomorrow!
