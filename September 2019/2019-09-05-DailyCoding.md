# Thursday September 5th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:18 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
8:00 - 8:15
Scrum meeting
Caught up on Chatwork/email

8:15 - 11:45
Did some research to better understand Parse commands.

Took notes on and discussed with team leader how the back-end of our API call works.

Integrated validation into the Redux form.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch

12:45 - 1:45
Rebuilt API from scratch to demonstrate baseline level of competence in this area.

1:45 - 5:00
Continued discussion with team leader on MVC model, and rebuilding the model (and controller) from scratch.

After office hours
5:00 - 6:00
Debugging popup. It seems another developer had the path going to the back-end instead of the front-end which is why my messages weren’t working (at least I think they made a mistake. I’ll have it confirmed tomorrow lol). 

Notes: A schema is basically a blueprint to ensure validation of key information in our JavaScript objects.

Redux form brilliant conditional rendering code snippet:
<Button variant="contained" type="submit" className={`${valid && 'btn-green'} change-email-btn`}>Button text goes here.</Button>
```
23:22 -- I also just spent about 45 minutes polishing up my React router haunted house project. It's almost finished now. I should be able to commit it to GitHub before bed tomorrow night.

I had a weird problem with eslint where it was saying almost all of my variables were unused. I must've configured it wrong somehow.

In any case, I learned a lot today. I've got one more day at the office tomorrow before the weekend!

The girl I'm dating and I have been kind of tense this week, so may not meet this weekend. If that ends up being the case, I'll at least be sure to start working on my next project!
