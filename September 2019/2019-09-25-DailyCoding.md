# Wednesday September 25th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:22 -- The last 2 days had been pretty rough. This morning things seemed to be continuing in that direction.

By the end of the day, however, one of my colleagues was kind enough to stay for almost one hour after work to help me complete the function I'd been stuck on the last several days, along with teaching me Postman in the process.

After work I also successfully built my first complete Redux-Saga API call function and everything that goes along with that (actions, reducers, etc).

While I still need to improve, it was good to finally build something by myself after work today after having been so reliant on my coworkers lately.

I'm going to try to get a solid night of rest, and continue the momentum tomorrow!
