# Monday September 30th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:40 -- I thought today was going to go well, but it was fairly frustrating. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Continued working on profile image/background image upload/cropping feature.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 6:15
Continued working on image/background image upload/cropping feature.


Notes:
-- Based on my current understanding, React Fragments are basically a way for us to wrap multiple child elements without having to use a wrapper div. This allows us to write shorter code, without the need for extra unnecessary div tags.

— There are two different syntaxes we can use to write fragments in React. We can use:
```
<React.Fragment>
	<child> </child>
	<child> </child>
</React.Fragment>
```
Alternatively, we can also use empty tags to serve as a React Fragment:
```
<>
	<child> </child>
	<child> </child>
</>
```

-- Highlighting multiple lines in VS code and then pressing tab will allow you to indent multiple lines. Pressing shift + tab will allow to to unintentionally multiple lines at once.

— Exif data is basically data that extends the pictures we take with our cameras or phones. Beyond merely the image itself, exif data also includes other information like the time the photo was taken, geolocation data, etc.

21:45 -- While I'm certain my skills as a developer are improving, the difficulty of the tasks I'm being assigned is growing at an equal if not faster rate.

21:47 -- I'm just going to keep hanging in there, putting in my 40 hours at the office and 5-10 additional hours outside of work each week.

21:48 -- As long as I'm putting in this amount of time bettering myself each week, I can't see how I won't reach a "solid junior" level in the next 6 months or so.

Until then... just taking things day by day.
