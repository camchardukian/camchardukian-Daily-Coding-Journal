# Tuesday September 3rd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal
20:56 -- I am so exhausted. Today was a decent day at the office. I had my first pull request merged, I learned a bit more about Git flow at my company, and I learned about how a child selector class nested inside of a parent element/class in CSS has a higher specificity than a normal class.

Thus, it's possible to override classes in Material UI without having to use IDs or the *!important* keyword. I also learned that using the *!important* keyword is generally discouraged (with some exceptions) because it can make it more difficult to debug your code.

In any case, I'm going to get a very early night of sleep tonight. I planned to do some extra coding after work today, but after having a rough night of sleep last night, I've been pretty much useless since coming home.

See you again tomorrow!
