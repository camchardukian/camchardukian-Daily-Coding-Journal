Destructuring/Props

```
19:31 — Now I’m watching a tutorial of a guy building a calculator with React. I’m going to watch the tutorial tonight, and then tomorrow I’ll start trying to build the app.

19:32 — Math.js is a math library for JavaScript and Node.js.

19:40 — While border is more widely known, there is another CSS property similar to border called outline. Outline is the same as border, except outline draws a line inside our element rather than outside it.

20:02 — I’m feeling pretty tired after watching that calculator tutorial. Tomorrow I’ll try to start coding along with the tutorial and hopefully I’ll be able to build a calculator myself by the end of the week :D

20:19 — Surprisingly, after taking a 15 minute break to go to the bathroom and meditate I don’t feel overly tired anymore.

20:20 — With that being said, my developer career is a marathon, not a sprint. I’m going to commit this journal entry to GitHub, get some exercise, and have a snack before going to bed.
