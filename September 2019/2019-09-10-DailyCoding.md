# Tuesday September 10th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:03 -- Today was a bit of a difficult day. My doll gave me a surprise visit last night, but that ended up
keeping me awake until almost 12:30. As a result, I only slept about 7 hours. Being a bit low on sleep plus having to do work with Redux today made it a pretty rough day.

I'm exhausted. I am starting to get comfortable with HTML/CSS/GIT in the context of the company's projects. Redux is still a bit difficult, however. I did read a couple articles tonight about Redux flow though.

Hopefully, tomorrow things will make more sense on a full night of sleep. Anyway, I'm going to do a brief 20 or so minutes of exercise, and then I'll get ready for bed so I can get a solid 8 or 8.5 hours of sleep tonight.

P.S. I forgot to take detailed notes at the office today. I'll try to get back on those again tomorrow.
