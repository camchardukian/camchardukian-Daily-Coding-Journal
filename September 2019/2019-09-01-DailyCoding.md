9:40 — I’m spending about 15 minutes to practice React-router before my English class this morning.

9:49 — Just got some additional practice with the Link tags and props. I’ll do more after this English class.

___

13:11 — Just added a little bit of additional content to my react-router practice application and watched a video on git checkout.

Later today I’ll sketch a diagram of what I’d like my app to look like. Then I’ll try breaking my app into different components, styling it, and just stretching myself to make this project a little bit more complete. See you then!

___
23:24 — I ended up programming a bit less than I expected today. Perhaps 50 minutes or so in total.

While that’s not what I was aiming for, I do also recognize the fact that I have been doing a LOT of programming the last couple weeks.

As such, I’m alright with one day of minimal forward progress.

I’m going to get to bed, and recover for a morning programming session tomorrow.
