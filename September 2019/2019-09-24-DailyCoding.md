# Tuesday September 24th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:33 -- Today was another fairly rough day.
While I'm understanding props and the flowing of data somewhat better, and while I understand Redux infinitely times better than I did a month ago, there's still sooooooo much to learn.

I feel like I'm still quite a way from being a legitimately productive member of my team.

In any case, I don't have much more to note. Today I did more work with props, Redux-Saga, HTML/CSS, React... nothing too out of ordinary.

I stayed late after work with my team leader. He was nice enough to try to explain some things to me about Redux-Saga, mapping inside of our React components, and so forth.

Even after he left, I continued working and was at the office until almost 7:30pm.

But hey, I don't have much more to say. I forgot my notes at the office so I won't go into any more details.

See you tomorrow.
