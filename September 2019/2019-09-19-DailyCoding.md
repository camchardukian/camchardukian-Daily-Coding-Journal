# Thursday September 19th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:23 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like today:

```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email.

Added connection list count to UI.

Pseudocoded, read API docs, tested API keyword parameter to ensure it was suitable for my use case.

Implemented search bar API call.


11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:00
Downloaded and started researching Postman

Talked with team leader about search bar/search function pull request

Refactored code

Added loading icon for while API has yet to have returned a user’s connections.

Starting working on block user UI

Notes:
— Postman is a tool for working with APIs (developing, testing, sharing, documenting, etc).

— If using “Post”, we can put the key-value pairs inside of the body inside the Postman app.

22:24 -- Today was my first day at work without being able to rely on my team leader to answer my questions. He took a trip to his hometown so I had to be more independent today.

I thought I did a pretty good job of that. I'm still far from being self-reliant, but I am getting closer and closer to being able to take a feature from start to finish on my own.

22:25 -- I also went to a "social beer hour" with a bunch of people from my company tonight. I'm not really into this kind of thing, but I thought it'd be a good idea to go to some social events with my coworkers at least once a month or so.

22:26 -- In any case, it's getting late. I'm going to eat my salad dinner, and then get ready for bed!
