# Thursday September 19th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:19 -- Today was a pretty darn chill day. I spent the vast, vast, majority of today sitting in meetings. My company just finished a sprint so all of the divisions came together and did demos, talked about what worked, didn't work, changes for the future etc.

22:21 -- As a result, today was a bizarre day in that while I was at the office for 8+ hours today, I only spent about 2-3 of those hours actually coding.

Today I just touched some Redux-Saga, React, and CSS. I also used GIT. One cool thing I learned today was that by writing:
```
git checkout -B myBranchNameHere
```
We can overwrite the previous branch with the new branch that we're creating. Anyway, tomorrow I'll try to do the course on Postman.

Another thing I've been thinking about is I'd like to continue to improve my Vietnamese. While my Vietnamese is solid for everyday conversations, it's definitely not where it needs to be in order to understand the majority of what's being said in these meetings.

I'd like to improve my Vietnamese to the point where virtually everyone at the company would prefer to speak Vietnamese to me over English because doing so would simply be that much easier.

Unfortunately, while I'm probably a high B1 or low B2 Vietnamese speaker on the CEFR scale. I probably need to get to a high C1 level in order to reach my goals.

That's going to take a significant amount of effort, but just about anything worth doing requires sacrifice.

In any case, I'm glad to finally be feeling semi-comfortable at my job.

Tomorrow I'll study Postman, and then maybe Sunday I'll either continue studying Postman or try to design the menu I need for next week.

See you tomorrow!
