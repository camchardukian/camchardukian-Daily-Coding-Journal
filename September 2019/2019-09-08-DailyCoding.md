# Sunday September 8th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:11 -- Today I caught up on sleep a little bit, taught an English class, cleaned my apartment, and got a massage.

I've felt kind of stressed out this weekend, so I decided to do like Dylan Israel says, and take a one day break to combat burn out.

With that being said, I still did spend about 3 hours programming since work ended on Friday.

I did the math, and if I program at least 40 hours this week,I'll have increased by total lifetime hours of coding by 25% in well under a month! Talk about cool.

Anyway, I'm tired. I'm going to get to bed a little early tonight to get ready to get back on the grind tomorrow.
