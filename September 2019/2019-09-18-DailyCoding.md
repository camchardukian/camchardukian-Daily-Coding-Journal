22:25 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like today: 
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard

Connected mouse

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Finished refactoring code and making pull request for display user connections feature.

Refactored other code

Sent completed tasks over to QA member for testing.

Did some light testing on my own features

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:00
Fixed forgot password API call

Added sliding search bar to connections list page.

Cleaned up some of my CSS
```
22:25 -- I'm not sure if I'm getting over being sick, but I've just been so tired lately. When I finish work I feel just completely drained and basically incapable of thinking.

In any case, today I learned a bit about passing parameters to API calls, and about using background images inside of an input element to make a sliding search bar.

Let's finish this journal entry and get to bed.
