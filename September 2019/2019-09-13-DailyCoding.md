Tried to do some work with Redux-Saga, and an API call, but wasnâ€™t able to finish.

Went home sick.

Notes:

Span element cannot have onClick event. Only button elements can have onClick event.
```

23:55 -- I've had some pretty bad headaches, backpain, etc, today. Luckily, my team leader was understanding and allowed me to take some time off this afternoon.

23:56 -- I'm going to go to sleep now, and hopefully will feel better tomorrow.
