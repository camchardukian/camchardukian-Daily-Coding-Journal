# Tuesday September 17th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:23 -- Man oh man, I'm beat. Today was my first day back at the office.

I felt pretty tired throughout, but I did end up successfully writing my first (mostly) solo (i.e. minimal help from other developers) API call with Redux-Saga.

That was pretty cool. Unfortunately, by the end of the workday I was pretty out of it, and forgot to take the notes I'd written and make a google docs out of them.

Oh well, I'll transfer the computer notes over to Google Docs tomorrow.

It just means that tonight's entry is going to be a bit short.

After work I ate dinner and then pretty much collapsed in my bed around 7pm.

I've already slept around 4 hours, but thought I'd quickly write this journal before continuing to sleep.

Tomorrow, I'll continue working with Redux-Saga, and hopefully getting these several hours of extra sleep will help me feel energized.
