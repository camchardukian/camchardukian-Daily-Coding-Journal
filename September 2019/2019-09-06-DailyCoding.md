# Thursday September 5th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:18 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Restarted computer

Connected keyboard

Connected mouse

8:00 - 9:00
Scrum meeting

Caught up on email/chatwork

Worked on API verification if email already exists or not

Added error popup

9:00 - 11:45
Demos/Meetings

11:45 - 12:45 
Lunch

12:45 - 2:20
Debugging API call/Parse code

2:20 - 5:40(I continued working after the rest of the team left.)
Finished debugging API call/Parse code and made pull requests for both my front-end and back-end code.
```
23:23 -- 12 days into my new life as a developer, I can do basic front-end tasks without needing too much oversight. I'm still pretty perplexed by the back-end though.

I'm not sure exactly what I'll practice tomorrow, but I'll try to get a couple hours of code in. Maybe I'll work on some more complex layouts now that I can create a basic one from a design in Zeplin.
