# Wednesday September 11th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:34 -- I again took pretty poor notes today at the office. Just been too tired this week:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard

Connected mouse

8:00 - 9:20
Scrum meeting

Fixed server bug with back-end developer teamm member

Refactored code and updated pull request

9:20 - 9:30
Caught up on Chatwork/email

Reviewed redux flow

9:30 - ??
Didnâ€™t take detailed notes on the rest of the day, but started a new task, and then fixed some old features by converting all of the back buttons in our application to utilize a new BackButton component rather than the React-router back-button icon combo we were previously using.

22:36 -- I already slept an hour after work, and I'm going to try to get to bed relatively early tonight so that I can get another 8.5 hours of sleep. 9.5 hours of sleep should help me feel less tired, and work productively tomorrow.
