21:50 -- When I came home tonight I also spent 30 minutes or so reading over, polishing, and pushing my notes for _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_. I'm officially finished with that book!

I learned a lot about design and OOP. Even with that being the case, I'm also excited to start reading something new. I'd been reading this last book since June so moving on to a new topic will be a nice change of pace! :D

In any case it's getting late so I'm going to call it a night. See you tomorrow!
