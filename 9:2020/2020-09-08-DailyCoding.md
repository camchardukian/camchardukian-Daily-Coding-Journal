19:34 -- As I've felt burnt out lately,I've been thinking about alternative ways of motivating myself.

I don't think I have it in me to continue grinding FreeCodeCamp projects as that's what I've spent the last 4 months doing.

For now, I think I'm going to take some time to work on passion projects, read software development books, or simply do some other activity to refresh myself until I'm ready to get back on the FCC grind.

Tonight for instance that meant spending about 40 minutes or reading about object-oriented programming.

Anyway, that's a quick update of how things are going. I'll see you again tomorrow! :))
