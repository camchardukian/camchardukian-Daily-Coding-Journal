# Sunday September 27th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

Today was a decent day. I taught English classes in the morning and then spent about an hour reading _Pro Git_ this evening.

Tonight I learned about a super cool feature in Git called _git reflog_. This tool basically is a storage log that updates whenever the tip of our branch updates.

While I don't yet feel my understanding of _git reflog_ is super deep yet, I now understand it well enough to see that it can be used to restore commits we've made if we accidentally delete our branch (assuming we made commits on the branch before deleting it).

Knowing where to look for deleted work is sure to come in handy someday!

In any case, I'm ready to call it a night. See you later.
