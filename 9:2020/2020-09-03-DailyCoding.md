# Thursday September 3rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

20:55 — Here we go. I’m back on the grind again. Tonight I’m starting with the 2nd exercise in _FreeCodeCamp’s Advanced Node and Express_ curriculum .

21:05 — The first lesson I went through today was pretty simple. The 2nd lesson for tonight (or 3rd lesson overall in the curriculum) is a bit more dense, however.

In the [Set up Passport](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/advanced-node-and-express/set-up-passport) lesson we’re learning about two new libraries.

The 1st is [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport). This library’s purpose is to authenticate requests and provide hooks to help us control when authentication either succeeds or fails.

The 2nd library is [expression-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session), which seems to be used for the creation of sessions objects and session cookies.

22:07 — Now that I’ve finished a couple of lessons on FCC, I’m going to spend a couple minutes reading _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_ before bed.
