# Monday September 14th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:56 -- Today was pretty much your average first day of a sprint. Here's what I did:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Sprint planning

Read documentation

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:00
Started working on adding custom menu items to menu creation flow

Resources:

Notes:
```

21:58 -- After work I spent some time reading and taking notes on the first chapter of the _Pro Git_ book. I think getting a deeper understanding of Git is important to become both a more independent developer as well as a better mentor for less experienced developers.

In any case, we'll call it a day here. See you tomorrow!
