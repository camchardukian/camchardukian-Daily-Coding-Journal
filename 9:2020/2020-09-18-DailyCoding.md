# Friday September 18th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:34 -- Today everyone at my company was a bit antsy because of some fairly major changes starting next week. That's more of a private nature, however, and not something that needs to be discussed here publicly.

In any case, here's what my day at the office looked like:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Building/distributing the business React Native app

Team meeting about the deployment process

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:00
Continued working on trying to fix input with formatted numbers having a cursor that jumps when deleting numbers

Read documentation

Resources:

Notes:
```

23:37 -- I didn't do much of anything coding related after work. Tomorrow I'll try to continue reading _Git Pro_ if I'm not feeling too tired.

See you then.
