# Tuesday September 29th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

19:17 -- Today was a solid day. Here's what I did at the office:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Read documentation

Added some skip buttons to the registration flow of one of our web apps

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:00
Improved the profile detail screen of one of our React Native apps

Resources:
Redux Form selecting form values: https://redux-form.com/8.3.0/examples/selectingformvalues/

Notes:
```

19:18 -- After work I also spent about an hour continuing to read _Pro Git_. Today I read mostly about rewriting our local commit history and git reset.

I definitely feel I understand these two topics more clearly after today's study session.

Now it's time to recover and enjoy some downtime. See you tomorrow.
