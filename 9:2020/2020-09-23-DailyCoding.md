# Wednesday September 23rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

20:36 -- Today was an interesting day of work. We're currently restructuring my team and rearranging which developers will work on which projects.

As a result, today was mostly a freebie day as we've finished all of the front-end tasks for this sprint.

For that reason, I spent most of the day researching _useMemo_ and _useCallback_.

Here's an outline of how I spent the day:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Fixed some of our Redux reducers to correctly order the company’s menu items

Helped review other team members’ pull requests

Spent some time reading documentation

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:00
Spent some time researching and building a basic demo app using useMemo and useCallback

Learn useCallback in 8 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyFP5s69N4


Notes:
Memoization is an optimization technique typically used to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive
function calls and returning a cached result when the same inputs occur again.
```

After work I also spent some time putting together my notes for the 4th chapter of _Pro Git_.

20:39 -- And now... I'm feeling pretty burnt. Time to get some rest. See you tomorrow.
