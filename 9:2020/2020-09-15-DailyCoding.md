Notes:
```

20:53 -- I also spent an hour or so at home continuing to read through the _Pro Git_ book. Thus far I've found this book much more engaging than _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_.

I think this is partically because the _Pro Git_ book is less dense than _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_. which definitely makes it "easier" to read.

I also think that reading about something you're using everyday is also more engaging because you can directly see how different theories may improve your workflow on a daily basis.

In any case, it's time to rejuvenate for tomorrow. See you later!
