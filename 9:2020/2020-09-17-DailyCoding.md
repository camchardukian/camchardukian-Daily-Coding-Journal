# Thursday September 17th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:15 -- Today was a pretty mehhh day. I felt pretty tired today. Here's what I did at the office:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Building/distributing our apps

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:05
Fixed both React Native apps to only call the renewSessionToken API if the user is already logged in.

Started working on trying to fix input with formatted numbers having a cursor that jumps when deleting numbers

Resources:
Xcode build input file cannot be found:

React Native Section List: https://reactnative.dev/docs/sectionlist

Cursor jumps to end of controlled input: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/955

Example source code for formatted controlled input: http://jsbin.com/dunutajuqo/edit?js,output

Notes:

The text input in react native has a selection prop to choose where the cursor resides and what characters (if any) inside the input will be highlighted/selected.
```

22:17 -- After work I felt pretty burnt so I wasn't able to get to any additional coding related stuff tonight. I hope to continue reading _Pro Git_ this weekend though :)
