# Tuesday September 1st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

15:30 — Today is a holiday in Vietnam so I’ve spent most of the morning and early afternoon taking it easy. Let’s take a few minutes now, however, to get started on FreeCodeCamp’s _Advanced Node and Express Challenges_.

15:33 — According to the [first lesson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/advanced-node-and-express/set-up-a-template-engine):

> “A template engine enables you to use static template files (such as those written in Pug) in your app.

Let’s research a bit to see what Pug is used for. I remember it being related to HTML, but I don’t know much beyond that.

Here are some of the basics of [Pug.js](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) based on [an article](https://medium.com/jspoint/pug-js-to-make-your-life-easier-with-html-templates-9c62273626e0) I just read:

- Pug.js is an HTML templating engine.
- Pug.js is also a JavaScript library.
- We can use Pug.js to write Pug code which the Pug compiler will compile into HTML code.
- One of the primary benefits Pug brings is that it allows us to use loops, conditions, mixins and more.

16:00 — I’ve just completed the first exercise which basically consisted of installing Pug, setting it up in my app, and rendering a Pug file using res.render(‘insertNameOfViewHere’). I’ll try to come back for another learning session later tonight.

22:38 -- Whoops. I missed failed to come back for my second coding session today. That's the bad thing.

On the positive side, I got an hour of exercise in for the first time in probably a month.

I'm going to try exercising more as I've gotten really out of shape this year and I think a healthy body contributes to a healthy mind.

In any case today was a pretty mehhh day off. But, hopefully having some time to just "waste" will help me come back somewhat mentally refreshed tomorrow.

See you then...
