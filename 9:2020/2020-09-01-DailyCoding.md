# Tuesday September 1st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:07 -- Man I'm beat. I've just felt really exhausted the last couple days. Anyway, here's what I did at the office today:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Started working on implementing permissions for camera and external storage for iOS in our React Native app.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:30
Continued working on implementing permissions for camera and external storage for iOS in our React Native app.

Notes:
```

22:08 -- I didn't do much coding outside of work today because I felt pretty tired after a long day at the office. I did, however, claim my APIs and Microservices certificate from FreeCodeCamp which was pretty cool.

I have off tomorrow because it's a holiday in Vietnam. Because of that, maybe I'll spend a little time continuing to work through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum...
