# Wednesday September 9th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

20:43 -- Here's what I did at the office today:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Finished fixing the main UI bugs ticket for this sprint.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:05
Made some small fixes, and built/distributed 4 applications.

Read documentation about writing tests in a cost effective manner.

Resources:
React Native Linking documentation: https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking

Notes:
```

20:44 -- Apart from that, after work I spent about 25 minutes continuing to read _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_.

I'll probably finish the book sometime this weekend. I'm not sure what I'll read next though. Maybe a book on TypeScript or GIT?

I still need to decide. Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.
