React Native Safe Area Context: https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context

Notes:
In Visual Studio Code, it’s possible (I’m not sure if it happens in every case yet) for deprecated code to be clearly indicated using strikethough text.

I also spent about 15 minutes or so after work reviewing, editing, and posting my notes for chapter 3 of _Git Pro_.

See you tomorrow.
