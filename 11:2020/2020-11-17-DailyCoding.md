23:27 -- After work I also spent around 30 minutes working on the _Eloquent JavaScript_ chapter 2 exercises. I finished the _Looping a Triangle_ and _Fizzbuzz_ exercises pretty easily tonight, but I haven't completed the _Chessboard_ exercise yet. I'll try to do it tomorrow.

It's pretty late now though so I'm going to try to get to bed. See you tomorrow!
