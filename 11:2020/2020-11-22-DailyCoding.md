# Sunday November 22nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:48 -- Today I taught some English classes, caught up on sleep, and spent some time socializing with a friend that I hadn't met for a year or two. I didn't do anything coding related, but I think doing some of these mentally restorative activities is also important for my mental health and long-term longevity in this industry. In any case, it's time to eat and get some rest. See you tomorrow.
