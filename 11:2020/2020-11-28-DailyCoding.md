# Saturday November 28th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:44 -- Today was another day of solid forward progress.
I spent about an hour researching _react-native-gesture-handler_ and implementing swipe actions into my react-native animated demo.

Tomorrow I'll try to put another hour or so into the react-native animated demo to clean up the code a bit and better understand how the internals of my basic app works.

For now, however, it's time to get some rest. See you tomorrow.
