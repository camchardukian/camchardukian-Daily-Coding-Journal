# Thursday November 19th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:03 -- This morning was a pretty normal morning at the office. This afternoon was pretty rough though. For some reason the back of one of hands started hurting whenever I was typing. As a result I spent the entire afternoon either typing in pain or typing one handed.

Things haven't gotten better after work despite icing my hand so I'm typing this one handed. It's exhausting:
