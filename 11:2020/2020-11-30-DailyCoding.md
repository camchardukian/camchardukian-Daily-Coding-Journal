21:15 -- I also spent about an hour after work trying to fix an issue with applying zIndex properties using the _cellRendererComponent_ prop on Android.

Unfortunately, I still haven't had much success thus far, but there's a pretty decent chance I solve it tomorrow I reckon.

In any case, I'm burnt. Talk to you tomorrow.
