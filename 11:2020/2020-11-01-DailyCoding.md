# Sunday November 1st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:22 -- Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get myself to do anything coding related today. I was able to teach some English classes this morning and exercise, but not able to get to code.

I think my awful night of sleep Friday night contributed to me feeling so unfocused this weekend. I'll try to exercise more in the near future so that I'm able to fall asleep more quickly and sleep more deeply.
