# Sunday November 29th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:38 -- I spent about 30-40 minutes today studying the React Animations app I built to better understand how everything works, and I also configured ESLint and configured some of the files.

I still need to fix the zIndex issue, but I'll solve that another day. For now I'd like to eat and get some exercise to take care of my physical body a little bit.

We're back on the grind tomorrow. See you then!
