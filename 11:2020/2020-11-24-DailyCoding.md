20:42 -- Apart from putting in an extra 15 minutes at the office, I also spent a little over an hour at home continuing to build a project with React Native Animated.

I'm also taking notes along the way as I build this project in order to be able to more easily explain various nuances of React Native Animated to my teammates.

In any case, I've sat at the computer for enough hours today. I'll catch you tomorrow!
