# Saturday November 7th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

Today was a really busy day. I taught five different English classes plus had a ton of commuting to do as well. Even with that being the case, I still made time to do some studying today.

That's something I can be proud of. Today I read and took notes on the introduction of _Eloquent JavaScript_. I invested about 40 minutes into my professional development as a software developer.

That's not amazing, but it isn't bad by any means either considering how much else I had on my plate today. In any case, I'll try to put a little time in even though I expect tomorrow to be similarly busy.

See you tomorrow.
