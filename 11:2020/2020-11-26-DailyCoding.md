```

22:56 -- I also spent over 1.5 hours continuing to work on my React Native Animated Api demo. Unfortunately, I'm having difficulties using zIndex with my FlatList.

I'm trying to reverse the zIndex of my flatlist items using the CellRendererProp but things aren't going well. I'm pretty stuck. Oh well, I'll give it another shot tomorrow.

I've got to go now as my battery is about to die. See you tomorrow!
