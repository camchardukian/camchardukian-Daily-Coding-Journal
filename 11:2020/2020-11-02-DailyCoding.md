23:12 -- After work I also spent about 30 minutes or so reading and taking notes on the last chapter of _Pro Git_. Tomorrow I'll write my final thoughts on the back, and then try to decide what my next learning endeavor will be.

Reading and taking notes on another book? Building some projects? I'm not sure yet. For now I'm just happy to call it a night and get to bed :)
