20:37 -- After work I also spent another hour or so working on my React Native Animated project. It's starting to come along decently, but I'm still having some issues with the stack order of my items. Oh well, I made a solid amount of forward progress today so I'm pretty happy. Tomorrow I'll try to put in another 1-2 hours improving my project. See you then.
