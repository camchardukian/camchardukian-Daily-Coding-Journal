# Friday July 12th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

Did not get around to coding today as I was moving into my new apartment, catching up with the girl I'm dating (and haven't seen in a month) and just exhausted from being jetlagged.

I did do some networking, however, and arranged an interview for Monday, and a job shadowing opportunity on Tuesday.

I'll try to gte back to working on my actual programming skills again starting tomorrow.
