11:53 -- Back to taking notes on Part II of the Webpack course...

* Webpack doesn't just add or append the JavaScript we've written to the end of our *main.js* file. Webpack actually wraps our code inside of "Webpack code" to perform some different "Webpack" magic on the code we've written.

* When we create a project using Webpack, we can add a few files to *.gitignore*. Neither *node_modules* nor *dist* need to be committed to GitHub.

This is because they would take up unnecessary space, and could both be easily derived from the rest of our code.

By running *npm install* we can get *node_modules*, and by running *npm start*, Webpack will build *dist* using *main.js*.

12:06 -- I've finished Part II. Now, I'm going to say goodbye to my Aunt because I probably won't see her again for another 1-2 years.

I'll also commit this journal entry to GitHub, and go through my morning routine.

Then, we'll tackle Part III of this course, which is about 'Imports, Exports, & Modules'.

See you later!
