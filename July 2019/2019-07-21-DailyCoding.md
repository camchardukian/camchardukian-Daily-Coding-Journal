# Sunday July 21th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal
To be perfectly honest, I have been dealing with some major anxiety and stress issues the last couple months.

While I've been plowing away regardless, I got away from my good habit of continuing to code each day.

Fortunately, while my stress levels are far from optimal, I did a fairly hard workout tonight for the first time in quite a while.

I also decided to catch up on this daily coding journal! :D
