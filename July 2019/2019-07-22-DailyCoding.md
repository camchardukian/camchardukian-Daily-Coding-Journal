# Monday July 22nd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

0:18 -- I caught up on daily coding journal entries that I failed to write/commit to GitHub over the last week or so.

22:39 -- Wow, it's been a long time since I've given this journal the attention it deserves.

Things have been crazy since I've gotten back to Saigon. Tons of resume editing, roughly 20 job applications, multiple interviews, visa extensions, looking for a new place to live...

The list goes on and on. To be honest, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of coding in today, but I'm going to try to do at least 20 minutes of focused work now so that I can try to get my momentum back with coding.

22:44 -- I'm going to try to get my React application running on my local server again.

22:46 — I’ve got my React app up running in the browser via localhost:3000.

22:51 — I’m working on getting my quote box div centered on the page. I know I can do this using flexbox, grids, or possibly floats. I know floats are a bit outdated, so I’ll see if I can use one of the more modern coding practices to align my div.

22:56 — Horizontally centering the div was easy enough. I just used margin: 0 auto. Now, however, I think it would also be nice to vertically center the div. Let’s see how I can go about doing that.

23:07 — Just finished watching a [useful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJVVZYTYA9U) on 5 ways to vertically center with CSS.

23:09 — Now the issue seems to be that my React application’s body only takes up a small portion of the actual viewport’s vertical space.

23:16 — I intend to solve the previous problem by nesting all of my other components inside a container, and making my container take up the entire height of the viewport.

23:21 — Interesting… I’ve created a container that houses all of my other React components. Strangely enough, however, setting my container’s height to 100% doesn’t stretch the container to equal the size of the viewport.

In fact, doing so makes no obvious changes. The only visible change I can see is by hard coding my container to be a certain number of pixels tall.

23:24 — In any case, I’m exhausted now. I’m happy to have made some progress on my Quotebox application, and even happier to have gotten back on track with programming. Now, I’m going to commit this journal to GitHub, rest, and continue the positive momentum tomorrow!

23:59 -- It was a pain getting everything committed to GitHub being that I'm so tired everything is a chore lol. On the bright side, we're getting back on track with coding!
