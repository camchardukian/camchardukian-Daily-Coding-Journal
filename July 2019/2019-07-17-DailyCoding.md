# Wednesday July 17th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

July 21st UPDATE: I got Waaaaay behind (like more than a week) on my daily coding journal so I am just posting this now.

On July 17th I spent a few hours coding in an office as a type of "job shadowing" or "apprenticeship" opportunity.

Here are some of my notes from that day...

11:18 — I’ve successfully solved the error I was dealing with earlier, but now I’m trying to figure out how I can customize my react project and make it my own.

I deleted the React svg file from my project, which could cause an issue if my App.js file was trying to import it. After deleting the import “svg” from “filepathsvg”, however, my app is still looking for the svg file for some reason.

11:25 — It looks like the issue may have been that I only saved some of my files before building my project rather than all of them. Duhhhh.

11:27 — I’ve got my local host running, and I’m making some basic changes to my application. Now I need to decide something to build. Maybe I’ll try to just build the FCC front-end libraries projects.

11:31 — I’ve got a gray background thus far. Now, I’d like to create a box or container that will hold the text. To be honest, however, I don’t remember exactly how I can do that hahaha. 

11:34 — I’m experimenting in Codepen as I think doing so will make it clearer how I should approach this issue in React (re: how to organize the various components I’ll need).

11:41 — Alright, I’ve refreshed myself on the basics of padding, margin, ems, etc. 

Trying to think about this conceptually, I believe I could break my project down into the following files:
App.js
index.js
QuoteBox.js
style.css
index.html
README.md

11:55 — I’m probably missing at least one file above, but now I’ve kind of got an idea of what I need to be doing.

12:30 — Got back from lunch about 10 minutes ago (ate from roughly 12:00-12:20). Now just got hooked up to an external monitor. This definitely feels like a more ergonomic setup, and a lot better for the neck instead of constantly staring down the entire time.

12:31 — Let’s get back to building the application we were working on before.

12:45 — I’m trying to add a QuoteBox component to my application. There seems to be an error, however, somewhere along the way of exporting, importing, and adding it to my App.js file.

13:03 — To be honest, I’m not sure what the problem ended up being. In any case, it’s solved now.

13:06 — I’m getting more comfortable with using React inside Visual Studio code already.  I’m sitting next to another developer right now, and brother is just completely knocked out.

I’m pretty exhausted too now at this point. i might have to join him lol.

13:09 — I guess the next thing I should probably do is add some CSS to my QuoteBox.

13:23 — I just spent some time reviewing how to use CSS with react. Now let’s get to implementing things!

13:36 — Added some basic styles already. I’ll add more later. I think I’m going to take a 5-10 minute break right now.
