23:32 — Still messing around with how I can vertically center my quotebox inside of its container.

23:49 — I have my Quotebox component kind of centered now. The only problem is that because my Header is also inside of my container,  my Quotebox is not centered perfectly (because I haven’t calculated specific percentages I guess).
