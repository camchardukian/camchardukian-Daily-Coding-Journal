21:51 —Today I made a border run to Cambodia to “unlock” another year of life in Vietnam :))

21:52 — Today I think I’ll try taking my “button”, which isn’t really a button yet, and making it clickable.

22:28 — I feel so utterly confused about how I should go about implementing this quote machine. I’ve looked back at my Memegenerator application to try to understand some things like making an API call (which reminded me about promises and chaining .then()), but mostly I feel so boggled right now.

22:31 — I think I’m going to do what I used to do when I got confused by algorithms. Find a working solution to the problem, copy it by hand, and then try to reimplement things myself.

22:32 — Now I’m feeling pretty discouraged, but I think I have a pretty decent plan going into my next coding session.
