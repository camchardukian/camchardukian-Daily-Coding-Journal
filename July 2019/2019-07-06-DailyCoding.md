# Saturday July 6th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

10:57 -- I'm back. Let's finish taking notes on Part V of the [Colt Steele Learn Webpack course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpGLUVbqoYQ).

I think I'll try formatting my notes a bit differently today. Instead of doing bullet points again I'll instead just write the note along with the time I took it.

Just for a change of pace.

11:01 -- We can install Bootstrap locally on our machine using the following command:
> npm install --save-dev bootstrap

11:06 -- There is a loader called the *sass-loader* that will load a Sass/SCSS file and compile it into regular CSS.

It's important to note, however, that using this loader requires installation of 2 packages: *sass-loader*, and *node-sass*.

11:10 -- Creating a "dev-server" can ease the development process because it will allow Webpack to recognize any changes we make any automatically rebundle all of our assets.

11:12 -- I just finished Part V of the course! Now, I'm going to commit this journal entry to GitHub, take a 10-15 minute break, and then continue on with part VI of the course!
