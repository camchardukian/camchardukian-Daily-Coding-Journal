# Monday July 15th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

While I didn't do any "coding practice", I interviewed for a React developer position, and received a verbal offer.

Unfortunately, because of my visa needing to be sorted out, this offer was made on more of a gentleman's handshake rather than a written contract.

I am proud to have reached a level where while I am far from competent, I at least have enough skills to interview well enough to land an entry-level position! :D
