0:12 — I used vh units for a pretty “hacky” solution to the positioning problem I was dealing with yesterday. The next thing I’d like to do is add a button to my application.

Initially, this button will not have any functionality. Later on, however, I’ll refactor my code so that clicking my button launches an API call that’ll fetch a new quote from a random quote API.

21:29 — Here we go. Today I moved into a new apartment, changed some currency, and prepared for a visa run to Cambodia I’m making tomorrow morning.

Now, let’s get a quick coding session in and keep the momentum going.

21:51 — I’ve added a button to my Quotebox application. My button does not do anything yet, and my application is quite ugly.

On the bright side, I’ve gotten everything positioned at least semi-decently.

21:58 — I’m definitely going to need to add some media queries later on.

22:00 — What do I need to do next? This first time through, my formatting is pretty whack. My CSS formatting skills definitely need more work.

Even with that being the case, however, I’m going to focus on functionality my first time completing this project. After I complete this project on my own, I can always watch a tutorial of someone else completing this same project, watch how they formatted things, and learn from my mistakes.

Seeing as I’m on my own for now, however, and the focus is on functionality, the next action step appears to be finding an API I can call on for my random quote application.

22:05 — [I’ve found an API](https://theysaidso.com/api/) that seems pretty decent for my intended use case.

22:06 — Now, I’m going to go finish the contract with my landlord, and eat a snack. I’ll try to get another coding session in later tonight…

22:49 -- Just spent the last 40+ minutes trying to figure out why my repo is only pushing my directory *FCC-Random-Quote-Machine* but not actually pushing any of its contents to GitHub.

I'm so confused and feeling quite discouraged at this point. In any case, I'm just going to commit this journal entry to GitHub, and then call it a day.
