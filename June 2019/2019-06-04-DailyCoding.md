# Tuesday June 4th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:21 -- Last night I stayed up suuuper late. I spent a lot of my time today making plans for what I'm going to do this summer.

I've found this lack of direction this past week or so provoking a lot of anxiety.

Within another day or two, I should have a fully developed plan for where I'm going to be this summer, and what opportunities I'm going to spend the next year of my life pursuing.

With that being said, let's try to keep the ship afloat in the meantime.

20:32 -- Updated node. Doing some initial setup for a project.

20:50 -- Having to update npm, homebrew, install yarn, etc.

21:00 -- Completed all of the above steps. Still cannot even launch an empty react application without errors O_O.

21:23 -- Over an hour and I'm still stuck with error this error that. I've tried changing scripts in JSON, configuring with both yarn and npm, and more.

I can't find the solution. I need to get help. I'm so frustrated beyond frustrated.

Tomorrow I'll have to try to reach out to some of the other developers in Vietnam.

I'm sure some other React developer will point out something obvious and I'll be able to calm down.

For now though, I'm clearly not being productive anymore. I'm going to get dinner, update my resume, and then make a plan for tomorrow.
