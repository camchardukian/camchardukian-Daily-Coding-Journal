# Wednesday June 12th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

2:48 -- Yesterday I didn't get any "hard coding" time in because I incorrectly estimated how long it would take to do 2 years worth of apartment cleaning, and get everything ready for my trip back to the USA.

2:49 -- Given that in a couple hours I'm going from Ho Chi Minh City to Tokyo to Los Angeles, I'm not sure how much coding time I'll be able to get in.

2:50 -- I suppose it will depend a lot on how much access to wifi I have as well as how long my computer's battery lasts.

2:51 -- In any case, I still haven't gotten any sleep yet (it's almost 3am!), but I thought it was important I at least commit this to GitHub to maintain my coding habit and walk the walk to demonstrate just how passionate I am about becoming a better developer.
