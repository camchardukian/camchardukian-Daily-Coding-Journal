# Thursday June 13th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:17 -- I'm so exhausted. The last 50 hours or so have been spent going from Saigon to Tokyo to Los Angeles, to Chicago, to my hometown.

While I got to spend 8-9 hours with my brother and another 8 hours or so with my parents, I'm so drained beyond drained now.

Fortunately, I'm ready for sleep right in alignment with when I should be getting ready to go to sleep on this half of the world.

I'm going to get some rest, and now that I'm finished commuting across the world, I'll spend tomorrow getting back on track with coding and the daily developer channel.
