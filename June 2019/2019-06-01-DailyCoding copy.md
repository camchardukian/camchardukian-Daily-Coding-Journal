# Saturday June 1st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

11:18 -- Here we go. I worked on another project outside of tech this morning, and now I'm going to try to get a quick pomodoro session in.

11:20 -- Today I'm going to go through [techsith's series on Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Erbf5NXQQw&list=PL7pEw9n3GkoWgIc-Ambc-QZGcTKEei2O3).

This series is a whopping 8 videos. I'll list the videos and some of the notes I took on each video below.

11:23 -- Here are some of my notes on video #1 -- [*Redux Introduction | How Redux works | Redux fundamentals*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Erbf5NXQQw)

* You may hate Redux if you don't understand it. Once you develop an understanding of it, however, it's quite simple and you will grow to love it.

* Redux is NOT part of React. It's a separate library that you can use with React (or any other JavaScript framework.)

* Global state is located in the store.

* The reducer holds functionality to modify the state.

* Redux can work in isolation. Using it doesn't require React.

11:33 -- That's the end of video one! I'm going to take a nap now, and we'll take notes on video #2 later!
