# Tuesday June 11th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:14 -- It's been a crazy day -- Doing two years worth of cleaning, exchanging money, packing my bags, going on a final dinner date with my girl, I didn't manage to get any time coding in today (the first time in about 7 weeks!).

22:15 -- In fact, I'm actually at dinner with my girl now and just refused to break my GitHub streak. While this isn't technically coding practice, I do feel a sense of pride about at least maintaining my commitment to upload to GitHub
