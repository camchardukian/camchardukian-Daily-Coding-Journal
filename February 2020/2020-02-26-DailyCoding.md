```
23:05 -- After work, I also spent 1.5+ hours working on my React Hook + Context calculator. Doing this gave me a nice refresher on floating point numbers in JavaScript.

23:06 -- Well, it's getting late now. I'm going to get to bed. I love the consistency that I've been coding outside of work the last couple days.

Let's try to keep it up! :D
