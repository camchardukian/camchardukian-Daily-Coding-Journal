# Wednesday February 5th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:59 -- I still felt a bit tired at work today, but did well slightly more energetic now that it's my second day back.

Here are some more details about what I got into today:
```
9:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Continued working on setting/reading/removing tokens using async storage.

Started adding logout functionality to the React Native + TypeScript project.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

13:45 - 17:30
Finished implementing rough draft login/logout features.

React Native Async Storage Additional Documentation: https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage/blob/LEGACY/docs/API.md#removeItem

Notes:
```

23:00 -- Today was another day of mostly working with TypeScript, Redux-Saga, and React Native.

Tomorrow, however, I'll get the chance to work with plain old ReactJS again. The version 0.1 of one of the projects I was working on got some feedback, so it'll be fun to work once again with a technology I have some decent experience in.

Anyway it's getting late so I'm going to try to get some sleep. Good night!
