# Thursday February 27th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:04 -- Today was a decent day of work. Here's what I got into at the office today:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Fixed some UI bugs

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:10

Did administrative paperwork

Worked on forgotPassword ui/implementation in React Native/TypeScript application.

Resources:

Running an App on Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app
```
I also spent maybe 90 minutes or so continuing to work on my React Context/Hook calculator outside of work despite feeling a little worn out today.

I made a conscious effort to push myself today because I figured tomorrow will likely be a lighter day of work due to having end-of-sprint meetings and other administrative tasks that need to be completed.

In any case, let's keep on grinding!
