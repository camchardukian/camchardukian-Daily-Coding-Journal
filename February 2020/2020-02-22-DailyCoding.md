# Saturday February 22nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:31 -- Today was a decent day of coding. I implemented the operator types functionality into my React Context calculator.

Now, when the user clicks '+', '-', etc, my calculator can recognize which operator type they intended to calculate with based on the button they clicked.

The operator type they chose now renders to the screen, but I haven't yet implemented the actual calculating part yet.

22:34 -- I think tomorrow I'll try to work on the actual math calculation part.
