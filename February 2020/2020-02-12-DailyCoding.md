# Wednesday February 12th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:18 -- Today was a kind of refresher day in some sense. It was the first day I focused on React (in place of React Native) in probably a month.

While I was a bit rusty with React at the beginning of the day, by the end of the day I felt like I got back into a good flow again.

Here's what my day looked like today:

```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Fixed formatting on student detail page 

Shared some knowledge about React Native modules with team lead

Started working on new mobile designs of existing web project

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:20
Worked on new design for add/edit video modal

Resources:

Notes:
```
23:21 -- I'm pretty tired from having moved to a new apartment yesterday, and still cleaning things up today. So, I'm going to start getting ready for bed now. Cheers!
