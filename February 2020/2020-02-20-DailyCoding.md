# Thursday February 20th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:01 -- Today was a pretty nice day. While I still had some headaches, they were less intense than the previous couple days.

Today I spent some time learning CSS Grid. I've relied pretty heavily on flexbox the last 6 months. I really like flexbox.

With that being said, it's always nice to get add another tool to your arsenal.

Here's what my full day at the office looked like today:
```

23:05 -- I'm going to get to bed now. See you tomorrow!
