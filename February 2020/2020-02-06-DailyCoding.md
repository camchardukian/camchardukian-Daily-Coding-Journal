Notes:
```
23:59 -- Today was my first full 8 hour day at the office since coming back from Chinese New Year. The previous couple days before today I worked roughly 7.5 hour days.

While I seem to be getting some mental strength back, most of my mental energy outside of work has been drained by trying to find a new long-term apartment.

I'm hoping to get everything settled by this weekend so that I can stop having my mental energy burned on things that don't have a direct impact on my professional development.

Anyway, it's way too late for me to be up writing this. Good night, and see you tomorrow!
