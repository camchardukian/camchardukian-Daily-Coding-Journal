# Friday February 14th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:48 -- Today was a light day of work  at the office due to the end of sprint meetings, and the company founder's birthday/Valentine's day party.

It was nice being able to chat with him 1-1 a bit. Isn't it interesting how during our social hour him of all people was sitting alone at a table?

Here's what my day at work looked like today:

Anyway, after work I did a little bit of work on my React Hook calculator. It seems to continue to advance on it I'll need to learn more about the React Context API.

For now though, let's get some sleep.
