# Sunday February 16th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

10:47 -- Let's keep working on our React Hook/React Context calculator!

11:55 -- During this morning session I implemented a random button into my calculator. I also did some work on trying to get the display to properly display the clicked number buttons.

I've implemented the current number display correctly, but I'm still having some difficulties properly storing the stored number (which I'll need to do in order to do calculations with multiple numbers).

11:57 -- See you again this afternoon/evening!

17:47 -- Let's try to grind for another hour or so!

19:04 -- During this coding session, I created a reusable component for the different types of arithmetic operators and created an alert message if the user tries to select a random number when the display already has a number.

The alert message is pretty ugly and hopefully just a temporary fix.

??????? -- we'll update this section at the end of the day.
