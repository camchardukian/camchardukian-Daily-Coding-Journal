# Saturday February 15th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:41 -- Today wasn't a very good day. I went to sleep way too late last night, and as a result I was really tired today.

This made it difficult to focus, and I ended up wasting a lot of time today.

With that being said, I did get at least 1 solid hour of coding practice in on my off day.

While I'd like to get at least 2 hour of coding in tomorrow, I can at least go to sleep tonight knowing I'm going to bed understanding React Context a bit better than I did this morning.

Let's regroup, and get back on track tomorrow!
