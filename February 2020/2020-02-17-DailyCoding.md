# Monday February 17th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:21 -- Today was kind of a down day at the office.

I had a bit of a headache, I had to attend to some paperwork, and I worked with my team to refactor some Material UI withStyles code to include JS constants for easier long-term maintenance. 

And those were just the side tasks today lol!

Here's what my full day at the office looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Finished working on edit company info

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:05

Did paperwork

Started working on new design for payment method.
```
21:25 -- I'm hoping that by getting to bed a little early tonight that I'll be able to kill this headache.
