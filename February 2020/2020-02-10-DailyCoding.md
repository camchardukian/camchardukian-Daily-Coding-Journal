# Monday February 10th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:36 -- Today was an awesome day. I got over 11 hours of work in today! I spent about 8.25 hours working on programming stuff and another 2.75 hours producing content. Anyway, here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Added Saga plugin to Reactotron

Added Async storage logging helper function

Helped explain the basics of React Context to teammate

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:15
Fixed some iOS compatibility issues in the TypeScript/React Native app.

Helped an intern to enable Reactotron on android.

Notes:
When setting up Reactotron with Android DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, stop your code from running when you paste ‘adb reverse tcp:9090 tcp:9090’ to connect your code to Reactotron. If you stop your code from running it will be impossible to connect, we made this mistake and lost a few hours needlessly debugging.
