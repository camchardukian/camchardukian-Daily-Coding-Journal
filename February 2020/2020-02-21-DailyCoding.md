# Friday February 21st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

19:05 -- Today was one of those days where things felt like they just weren't going my way. At least that's what I thought at first.

It turns out, however, that my "naive" solutions to the problems I was getting stuck on weren't actually that different from what another teammate and even my team lead tried.

My team lead claimed that a senior developer would be able to solve the issue I was stuck on in less than 10 minutes and challenged me to try to solve it in 30 minutes.

I tried, but couldn't finish. 1.5 hours later... neither could he.

It just goes to show you that when you're having a bad day, you're probably not as bad of a developer as you think.

On the other hand, the same applied for when you're having a good day.

Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```

19:10 -- That's all for today. See you tomorrow!
