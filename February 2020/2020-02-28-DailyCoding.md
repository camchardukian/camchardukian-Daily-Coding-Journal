# Friday February 28th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:04 -- Today was an "ok" day at work. Most of the day was spent in meetings and doing administrative tasks rather than coding.

Here's what my full day looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Administrative work

Worked on react native/typescript

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:15

Meeting

Worked on client feedback
```
22:06 -- I have been feeling a little bit down today. Hopefully it's just a case of being overtired, and getting some sleep will fix things.

22:07 -- In any case, see you tomorrow!
