# Friday February 7th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:58 -- Today was a solid day at work. It was one of those days where I felt like my knowledge was really solid and I was able to do even fairly difficult tasks on my own.

Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Refined improvements made per 0.1 bug report

Fixed bugs/made UI improvements on student list/student detail pages

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

13:45 - 17:05

Installed and configured Reactotron.

Resources:

GitHub issue about having difficulty installing Reactotron: https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/issues/1140

Quick start React Native Reactotron tutorial: https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/blob/master/docs/quick-start-react-native.md

Reactotron with Redux: https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/blob/master/docs/plugin-redux.md

Cannot invoke an object which may be undefined: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31609

Notes:

I couldn’t seem to properly install Reactotron to macOS Catalina via the official docs. Doing so only resulted in an error message that said, ‘’the application reactotron can’t be opened”.  To resolve this error, I instead installed Reactotron using Homebrew with the following command ‘brew cask install reactotron’.

We can use the ‘__DEV__’ variable in React Native to see whether our application is running in development or production.

By using the exclamation mark ’!’ at the end of an object, we can ensure that that object is ‘not null’.
```
23:59 -- This weekend I have some more life maintenance type stuff I need to attend to:
* Prepare 2019 tax information.
* Find a new apartment.
* Plan out goals/habits for the next several months.

With that being said, I do hope to get into a more regular habit of producing coding videos once I take care of everything this weekend and get settled back into Ho Chi Minh City.

Anyway, see you tomorrow!
