# Tuesday February 18th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

20:09 -- Today was a decent day at the office. There wasn't much particularly notable about today.

20:10 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Continued working on payment method new design

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Walk

12:45 - 17:15

Completed the new design for the payment method page

Started working on the new mobile design for the change password/change password successfully pages.

Notes:
If we want to change a button’s text based on the user’s screen size, one method of doing so is by placing the text inside of a span tag. Then, we can use CSS rules plus media queries to specify which span should display based on different screen sizes.
```
20:11 -- I've still been dealing with headaches today. I'm hoping these are just the result of going on 6.5-7 hours of sleep the last couple nights instead of the regular 8-9 hours.

Hopefully I can get a solid night of rest and knock these headaches out.

See you tomorrow!
