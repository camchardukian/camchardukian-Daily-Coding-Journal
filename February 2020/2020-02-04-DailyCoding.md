# Tuesday February 4th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:54 -- Hey! It's been a while since the last entry. I've spent most of the past few weeks traveling, and enjoying some true time off for the first time in a couple years.

21:55 -- Here's what I got into today at the office:
```
8:00 - 11:45

Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Debugging Redux-Saga bugs in React Native project.

11:45 - 13:45
Lunch/Nap

13:45: - 17:35
 Fixed some redux-saga bugs, and shifted from relying on local storage to using async storage throughout the app.

Resources:

Async storage React Native (kind of like a substitute for local storage): https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage

Redux persist: https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist

Notes:
```
21:57 -- I was quite tired today as I had a late flight and wasn't able to get to sleep until about 1am last night. But, it's still good to get back on the grind.

I'm looking forward to getting back into my routines so that I can supercharge my productivity again.

I intend to continue to work hard so that I can become a mid-level developer sooner rather than later. We'll talk about that more another day though.

I'm exhausted. Nice to see you again. See you tomorrow!
