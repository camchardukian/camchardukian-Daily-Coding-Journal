# Sunday February 23rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:55 -- Today was a decent "off-day". I spent about two hours working on my React Hook + Context calculator.

I didn't make a whole lot of actual progress because I got stuck. For that reason, [I created an issue](https://github.com/theranbrig/calculator/issues/1) on another React Hook + Context calculator asking for help.

I'm not sure if the owner will be willing to spend a few minutes looking over my code, but I figured it would be worth a shot asking him.

I also posted my code in a Facebook group for software developers. If neither of these produces any insights, maybe I'll try to ask my team lead where I went wrong as I've already spent a few hours on this problem banging my head against the wall while seemingly making very little progress.

22:59 -- In any case, we're just going to keep trying to plow along and get better each week. Thanks for coming along for the ride. See you tomorrow :)
