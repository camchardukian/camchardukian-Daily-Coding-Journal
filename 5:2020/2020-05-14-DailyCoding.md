```
23:45 -- I also spent an hour or so continuing to work on my TypeScript calculator after work. While each day I'm solidifying my knowledge of a basic TypeScript concept or 2 each day, I haven't made much progress the last few days in regards to the functionality of my app.

With that being said, I imagine things will speed up once I get more comfortable with the basics of using the different React Hooks with TypeScript.
