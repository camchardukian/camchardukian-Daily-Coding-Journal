22:06 -- Today was another day where I found it pretty difficult to focus. While I'm not sure why focusing has been so difficult this week, I'm going to try to get 9+ hours of sleep tonight.

I don't think my mental fogginess issues are the result of poor sleep quality, but getting some extra sleep won't hurt at the very least.
