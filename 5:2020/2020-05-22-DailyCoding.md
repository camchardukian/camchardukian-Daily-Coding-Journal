23:41 -- Today was a solid day at the office. I don't know if I'll spend a lot of time coding this weekend because I have to teach sveral hours of English classes each day.

But... I'll try to spend an hour or two finally getting my TypeScript and React Context hook in my calculator all synced up :D
