# Sunday May 3rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

6:45 -- Here we go. It's time for an early morning coding session! :D This morning I've been reading a bit about [HTML sanitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_sanitization) before I attempt to sanitize the HTML in [my Markdown Previewer project](https://github.com/camchardukian/fcc-markdown-previewer).

Now that I understand the concept of sanitizing HTML, it's time to get to work in actually applying this knowledge! :D

6:59 -- I'm going to try using the [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) library to sanitize my HTML.

8:05 -- It's been a good morning. I've finished the FreeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer project! Check out [my repo here](https://github.com/camchardukian/fcc-markdown-previewer)!

8:09 -- The next project on the list is building a drum machine. I have literally no idea how I'm going to do this.

But... I've already built a JavaScript calculator a couple months ago using React Hooks.

If I've already built a calculator which is the 4th project in their curriculum, surely I can complete the 3rd project in the curriculum...

And surely we'll learn some cool stuff in the process :)
