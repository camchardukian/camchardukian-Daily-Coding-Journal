# Sunday May 3rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

6:45 -- Here we go. It's time for an early morning coding session! :D This morning I've been reading a bit about [HTML sanitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_sanitization) before I attempt to sanitize the HTML in [my Markdown Previewer project](https://github.com/camchardukian/fcc-markdown-previewer).

Now that I understand the concept of sanitizing HTML, it's time to get to work in actually applying this knowledge! :D

6:59 -- I'm going to try using the [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) library to sanitize my HTML.

8:05 -- It's been a good morning. I've finished the FreeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer project! Check out [my repo here](https://github.com/camchardukian/fcc-markdown-previewer)!

8:09 -- The next project on the list is building a drum machine. I have literally no idea how I'm going to do this.

But... I've already built a JavaScript calculator a couple months ago using React Hooks.

If I've already built a calculator which is the 4th project in their curriculum, surely I can complete the 3rd project in the curriculum...

And surely we'll learn some cool stuff in the process :)

19:00 -- So far this drum machine project has been coming along a lot easier than I expected.

While the holidays are over and I'll be back to work at the office tomorrow as usual, I wouldn't be surprised if I finish this drum machine project within the next 2-3 days in my free time after work.

19:04 -- In any case, I'm really proud of the progress I made on this FCC certificate these last 4 days. I'm about halfway finished with the certificate already, and I'm very confident I'll be able to finish the entire certificate by the end of the month.

I've gained a lot of confidence in my development skills this weekend, and I'm excited to continue working on these projects over the next few weeks and earn my 1st new certificate in over a year! :D
