23:18 -- I also spent an hour or so coding after work today and finally got the React Context Hook to work with TypeScript! :D

23:19 -- My TypeScript calculator still has a loooong way to go, but I'm feeling a lot more confident about the status of this project now that I've laid down the basic structure using TypeScript.

In any case, it's getting late. I need to get ready for bed. See you tomorrow!
