# Tuesday May 12th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:22 -- Today was an interesting day at work because the manager of my team was off in the morning. For that reason, I took his place in the manager meeting with the Japan team today.

It was fun getting to join the meeting because it gave me more insight into the daily concerns of managers and directors of a technical company.

Anyway, here's what my full schedule looked like at the office today:
```
