# Tuesday May 5th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:53 -- Happy Cinco de Mayo! :D Today was a pretty average day at work. My day looked like this:

Notes:
```
21:55 -- After work today I also spent about an hour finishing up my FreeCodeCamp drum machine project. It's now finished!

My goal is still to finish the rest of this certification by the end of May. While 3+ weeks sounds like a lot of time, I may start teaching English weekend mornings again for extra cash flow -- I'm still undecided on that.

If I do start teaching again, I'd like to complete this certificate by the end of this month, and the API/Microservices FreeCodeCamp certificate by the end of the year.

If I don't teach again, I may make my goal a bit more aggressive and try to finish that certificate by Halloween. 

In any case, I'm exhausted. Let's get to bed and try to catch up on sleep. :)
