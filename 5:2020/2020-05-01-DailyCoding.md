# Friday May 1st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:57 -- Today was a good day. I spent about 2.75 hours coding and finished my first FreeCodeCamp front-end library project! Tomorrow I'll continue with the 2nd project. If all goes well, maybe I'll finish all of the projects and get the certificate by the end of May! Maybe ;)

For now though, it's getting late. Good night. See you tomorrow.
