# Sunday May 31st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

19:52 -- Today was a pretty decent day. I spent several hours teaching English this morning and then another hour or so working on my TypeScript calculator tonight.

My TS calculator now passes 14/16 FCC tests. I've been in a good coding groove lately as far as my practice/side projects have been concerned.

I attribute this increased energy and enthusiasm to exercising more regularly these days and having recently gotten a modest raise at my company! Lately I've been motivated both physically and psycholigcally. Let's keep up the hard work this week! :D
