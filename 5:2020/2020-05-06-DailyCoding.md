23:12 -- Today was my first day being a "mentor". It's crazy that at this time one year ago I had never seen a line of React code, and now I'm mentoring a CS student on React and React Native preparing them to contribute to a real project!

Anyway, today I was proud of both myself and my mentee. We were able to get all the dependencies for React Native installed, and get the app running on her simulator.

In the process, I was able to help every time she got stuck with some bug.

While I'm still very much a junior dev, I've come a long way! :D

In any case, it's getting quite late so I should get to sleep. Good night!

P.S. I spent about 40 minutes before work this morning setting up a typescript project to get more comfortable writing TS on my own, as well as to complete FreeCodeCamp's 4th of 5 challenges necessary to earn the Front End Libraries Certificate.
