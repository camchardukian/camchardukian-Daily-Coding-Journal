# Thursday May 28th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:26 -- Today was a great day for coding. Here's what I did at the office:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Continued working on applicant detail

Reviewed menteeâ€™s code and helped set OKRs.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:15
Quarterly performance review

Continued working on applicant detail admin feature and web applicant detail bug fix.

Notes:
```

23:28 -- After work I also implemented mathematical operations into my TypeScript calculator. My calculator is coming along well. I'm guessing I'll probably need another 3ish hours to complete it.

It'd be nice to finish it by Monday night or so. Then, I can work hard to finish the final FCC front-end library certification before the end of June.
