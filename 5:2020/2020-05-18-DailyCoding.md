# Monday May 18th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:03 -- Today was a pretty off day. For some reason, my thinking just felt really unclear today. Anyway, here's how I spent the day at the office:

Caught up on Slack/email

Code review

OKR meeting

Continued working on applicant detail popup
 
11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:50
Finished adding real data to applicant detail popup layout, and implemented ignore function.
