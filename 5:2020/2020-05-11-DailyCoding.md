# Monday May 11th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:55 -- Today was a bit of an unusual day as I spent about the same time working on my own development tasks as I spent in meetings/supporting my mentee intern to work on her tasks.

Here's what my day looked like:
```

8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

OKR/KPT Mentor/Mentee meeting

Started working on applying version 0.1 web feedback from client

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:20
Beginning of sprint planning

Continued working on applying version 0.1 web feedback from client

Created task for mentee and helped explain the motivation behind prop checking and 
the advantages of TypeScript over React prop types.

21:58 -- Having read *The Beginner's Guide to OKR* ended up being really helpful as I conducted an OKR/KPT meeting for the first time today.

21:58 -- In any case, I'm tired so I'm going to eat dinner and get to bed. See you tomorrow!
