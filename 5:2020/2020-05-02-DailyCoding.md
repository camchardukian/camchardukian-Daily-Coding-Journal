# Saturday May 2nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:37 -- Today was a decent day of coding. I spent just under 2.5 hours coding today. I worked on the FreeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer and made some pretty decent progress.

Today I took some Markdown code, and converted it to HTML. Tomorrow I'll try to sanitize the HTML. I think I'm well on my way to finishing this project tomorrow!

At least I hope so ;)
