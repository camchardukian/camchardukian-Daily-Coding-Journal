23:03 -- Although I'm a little bit sleep deprived from a bad night of sleep two nights ago, I got some exercise after work today and also spent about 50 minutes on my freeCodeCamp Drum Machine tonight!

Tonight I learned about how to use the HTML audio element. I implemented audio into my app so that whenever a user clicks a certain button on the screen a corresponding sound will play.

I think either tomorrow or Wednesday I'll be able to finish the rest of the project! :D

We'll worry about that later though. Now it's getting late so I need to get to bed. See you tomorrow!
