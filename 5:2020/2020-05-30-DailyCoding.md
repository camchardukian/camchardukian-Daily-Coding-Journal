# Saturday May 30th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

19:24 -- Today was a great day. My English classes in the morning went really well. I also had time to hang out with an old friend in the afternoon for a couple hours.

Finally, I spent almost 2 hours working on my TypeScript calculator today. From that time, I was able to fix a bug regarding decimal points and trailing zeroes without having to fudge up the types for my variables too much.

My TypeScript calculator now passes 13/16 FCC tests! I'm probably just 2 coding sessions away from being finished with this project's functionality! :D
