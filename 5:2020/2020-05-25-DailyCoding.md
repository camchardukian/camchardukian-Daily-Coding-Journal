21:39 -- I've now been a developer for over 9 months! It's weird to think that I'm starting to get fairly close to having 1 year of full-time software developer experience.

We've come a long way, but the path ahead still has TONS for us to discover. Let's keep pushing hard and see what we can accomplish this summer! :D
