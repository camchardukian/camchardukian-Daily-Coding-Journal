23:01 -- After work, I implemented a clear button into my TypeScript/React Context calculator. My calculator now passes 7/16 FreeCodeCamp unit tests.

Tomorrow I'll try to tackle the mathematical operators for the calculator (division, multiplication, subtraction,addition) along with the equals button.

For now, however, I'm ready for bed after a long day of work. Let's get some rest, and regroup for tomorrow!
