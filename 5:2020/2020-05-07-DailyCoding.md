12:45 - 17:30

Continued working on updating the React Native Gifted Chat functionality

Implemented React Native splash screen

Started implementing back button fix

Resources:

Notes:
```

22:04 -- After work, I also came home and worked on my TypeScript calculator a bit too. Today I implemented the UI for the reusable number button.

I also used a TS interface for my props and in the process found [this article](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/typescript-building-react-components) really useful.

22:06 -- I still have a long way to go on my calculator project. It currently only passes 3/16 unit tests. However... this morning it only passed 1/16 tests so we are making progress. Slowly but surely ;)

22:07 -- Anyway, that's about all I have to share for today. See you tomorrow! :)
