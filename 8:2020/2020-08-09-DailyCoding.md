# Sunday August 9th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:07 -- I didn't do much related to code today as I spent most of the day teaching English and moving into my new apartment.

Tomorrow I'll be back to the 9-5 grind so hopefully I'll have something more interesting to report at that time. See you then.
