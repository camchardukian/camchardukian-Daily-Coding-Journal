# Sunday August 2nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:24 -- Today was a decent day of coding. I spent about 1.75 hours this evening continuing to work on the FreeCodeCamp URL shortener project.

I didn't make much visible progress today, but I did connect my database and learn a bit about the different ways our data may be encoded when making a request encoded as well as why we need to use _bodyParser_ with express.

In any case, I'm going to get some rest now. See you tomorrow.
