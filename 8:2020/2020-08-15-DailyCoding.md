# Saturday August 15th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:19 -- I didn't do much coding related stuff today. This morning I taught some English classes, in the afternoon I took a several hour nap to catch up on sleep (I haven't been sleeping well this week), and then I tonight I went out for a dinner date as I've spent almost the entirety of the last two weeks either working or just chilling at home.

Anyway, I'll try to put in another hour or so into my _FreeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker_ project tomorrow. See you then!
