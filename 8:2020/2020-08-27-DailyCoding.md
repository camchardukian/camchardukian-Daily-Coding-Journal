# Thursday August 27th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:50 -- Today was a solid day at work. Here's how I spent my day at the office:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Fixed some bugs to improve the UX on the payment screen

Built and deployed two different React Native apps to Appcenter; both iOS and Android versions for both apps (4 total builds).

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:10
Refactored the React Native app for more consistent use of the useTranslation hook.

21:51 -- After work I also spent an hour or so learning more about Chai and Mocha. About half of this time was spent doing the Quality Assurance exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

The other half was spent watching [this video on Chai and Mocha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxE1D5qbQJU). Here are some things I took away from watching:

```
Mocha is  a testing framework and Chai is a testing library.

Mocha takes the results of the tests we run, and helps us to see how many of our tests passed and how many failed.

We can use it.only() to choose which test(s) we would like to run if we don’t need to run all of them.

Alternatively, we could also use it.skip() if there are some tests we don’t need to run for the time being.

Running tests that fail is what allows you to identify problems inside of your application and thus identify opportunities to refactor for improvement
```

21:54 -- Overall, I'd say today was a very solid day of work. Let's eat a little, and get some rest.

Then... we'll get ready for another day of grinding tomorrow :))
