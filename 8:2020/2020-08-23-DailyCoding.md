# Sunday August 23rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:38 -- Today was a pretty decent day. I spent about 4 hours or so teaching English this morning. I spent another 1.15 hours or so polishing my FreeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker and reading _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_.

My exercise tracker application is on the brink of success. My app now passes 5/6 FreeCodeCamp unit tests, and seems to produce the correct results in every common situation.

I don't understand why my project hasn't yet been able to pass all of the unit tests so I made a post in FreeCodeCamp's forum asking for clarification for whether there was an issue with my source code or merely technical difficulties (FreeCodeCamp has been having difficulties with Glitch lately).

In any case, today was a solid day. Let's call it a night and get some sleep. See you tomorrow!
