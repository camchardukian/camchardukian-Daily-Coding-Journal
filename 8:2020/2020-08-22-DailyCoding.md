# Saturday August 22nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:20 -- Today was pretty good as far as coding is concerned. I spent a little over 1.5 hours continuing to work on my FreeCodeCamp exercise tracker this evening.

The tracker's basic functionality seems to be almost complete. I just need to see why some edge cases are causing the final two unit tests to fail.

23:23 -- In any case, I'm exhausted. I'm going to get some sleep. See you tomorrow!
