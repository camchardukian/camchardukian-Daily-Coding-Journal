# Saturday August 1st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

17:29 — I’m going to try to get back on the grind today after what has been a fairly traumatic week.

To try to get back to feeling my normal self, I’ve educated myself on precautions I can take to avoid similar situations in the future.

I’ve also tried to research and practice forgiveness to both myself and the person that harmed me. This is a process I’m working through right now.

I’m determined to ensure this somewhat traumatic event can be used to both better my future, but also improve the evolution of the human consciousness via the development of my character. I intend for my future content creations effort that may be inspired by this event to raise the collective consciousness of human beings, even if only slightly.

I believe that as a player in the game of life, we should try to turn any negative that happens to us, and convert it into a positive.

This doesn’t mean not to acknowledge pain, or overlook mistakes we have made. But I watched a video today where the speaker said something along the lines of, “Forgiveness is giving up hope for a better past”.

We cannot change the past, but we can learn from it, and leverage it to improve both our personal future successes as well as the evolution of the human consciousness.

17:36 — In any case, let’s get back on the coding grind. Today I’m going to start working on the 3rd project in the FreeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices curriculum.

The 3rd project in their curriculum is a [URL Shortener](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice).

While I don’t really know where to start with this project, the first thing I noticed is that FreeCodeCamp suggests that we can see if a URL is a valid website by using the _dns.lookup(host, cb)_ method from the _dns_ module.

I guess that may be a good place to start with our research today!

17:42 — Here are some notes I’ve taken about DNS (mostly from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTo6R5JIGw)):

- DNS stands for Domain Name System.

- The most important thing DNS does is take domain names and converts them into ip addresses (because computers generally “understand” numbers and binary data more easily than text).

- The _dns.lookup()_ method’s 2nd parameter is a callback function. That callback function takes two additional parameters, an error and a value.

19:03 — I just cloned/remixed FreeCodeCamp’s boilerplate for this project on Glitch. Now, I’m going to install the [body parser package]().

19:24 — I’ve gotten the body parser package setup, but imagine my surprise when my basically empty project somehow passed all of FCC’s unit tests for this project. Looks like someone messed up somewhere with these tests _sigh_.

While FreeCodeCamp has already given me “credit” for completing this challenge, I am of course still going to try to complete this project the legit way as the purpose of completing these projects is to learn and not just try and “rush through” everything.

19:26 — In any case, I’ve gotten some of the basic structure of this project setup but I still need to add the database.

I’ll probably do that tomorrow as my girl and I haven’t had a date night in a couple months at this point and Vietnam looks like it may be headed back into quarantine in the next month or so.

See you tomorrow…
