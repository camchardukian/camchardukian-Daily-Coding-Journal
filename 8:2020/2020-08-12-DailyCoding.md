# Wednesday August 12th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:49 -- Today was a pretty average day at work. Here's what I did:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Starting adding credit cards to the settlementDetail screen

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:30
Finished adding credit cards to the settlementDetail screen

Started working on the cash payment QR code scanning flow

Notes:
```

22:51 -- I also spent a few minutes after work getting the skeleton of FreeCodeCamp exercise tracker project ready. I imagine this project will probably take a couple weeks as it seems to be more complex than the previous projects.

With that being said, I'm confident that I'll be able to complete it. It's just a matter of putting in the hours.

Hopefully, we'll be able to collect the next certificate by the first or second week of September.

Anyway, I'm pretty exhausted so we're going to call it a day here. See you tomorrow.
