# Tuesday August 25th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:23 -- Today was a pretty good day. My time at the office was pretty normal:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Continued working on the add discount by amount or percentage feature

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:00
Continued working on the add discount by amount or percentage feature

Resources:

Notes:
```

22:24 -- I invested another hour or so into my professional development after work, however, and this felt much more fulfilling to me.

Today I achieved a pretty significant milestone (at least for me). I finished building the 4th and 5th projects in the FreeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices curriculum!

We did it baby!

While it wasn't easy persay, this certificate was very doable by just consistently putting the time in everyday. We even managed to finish the entire certificate in under 2 months!

I'll probably wait until September 1st to claim the certificate, however, as I think putting two certificates on my resume and having them display as having been earned in consecutive months may downplay the amount of effort required to grind our way through the _Front-end Libraries_ and _APIs and Microservices_ curriculums.

In any case, I'm going to call it a night now. See you tomorrow!
