GraphQL vs REST: https://dev.to/sadarshannaiynar/graphql-or-rest-what-should-i-use-38mj

Notes:
GraphQL uses Schemas which are strongly types and can serve to be self-documenting.

GraphQL allows the client to specify which fields they need.

GraphQL is transport layer agnostic.

RESTful services report errors more clearly than GraphQL.

RESTful services can loosely be labeled as having a tendency to be more stable and secure while GraphQL may be able to offer benefits in performance.
```

After work I also spent about 30 minutes or so researching about Chai, Behavior Driven Development (BDD), and then started to work on the FreeCodeCamp Quality Assurance Certification.

Tomorrow I'll go to work at the office and then continue the QA challenges in my free time. Anyway, it's time to get some rest. See you tomorrow!
