# Sunday August 16th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:39 -- Today was a pretty solid day. I spent about 4 hours or so in the morning teaching English classes. Then, in the afternoon and evening I spent over 2 hours continuing to work on my _FreeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker_ project.

I made some pretty decent progress today, and got a lot more comfortable with finding and updating database items. With that being said, there's still a fairly long way to go on this project. No matter, we'll just keep putting in the time and get there before we know it.

Anyway, let's call it a day, grab dinner, and get some rest. It's time to regroup for the coming week. See you tomorrow.
