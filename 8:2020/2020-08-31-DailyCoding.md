# Monday August 31th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:54 -- Ehhh. I guess that's the best way to describe today. I felt pretty exhausted this morning so I went into work a couple hours late.

I stayed an hour afterwords to "catchup" so I ended up working 7 hours instead of the usual 8 at the office.

Even with that being the case, however,I still felt like I was struggling through today.

That's enough of ranting though. Here's what I did at the office today:

```
10:00 - 11:45
Caught up on email/slack

Fixed some UI bugs in two of our React Native apps.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 18:00
Fixed some validation issues on the update profile page.

Read the React-Native Camera docs and started working on implementing some of the client requests for improvements.

Notes:
```

22:59 -- Tomorrow is the last day before we get Wednesday off for the holidays.

In any case, I'm going to get some rest and hopefully tackle tomorrow with more energy than I had today. See you then.
