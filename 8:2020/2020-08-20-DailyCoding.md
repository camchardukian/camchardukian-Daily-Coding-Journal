# Thursday August 20th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:05 -- Today was a mentally draining day at work:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Improved stability of credit card payment flow

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:35
Improved stability of credit card payment flow

Resources:
React Native Custom Hooks: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html

Notes:
```

22:07 -- Even with that being the case, I was able to summon an extra hour of effort to continue to make progress on my FreeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker.

Today I fixed the create new user API, improved the _user_ Mongoose schema, added a "get all users" API, and also started to improve the add new exercise API.

My app now passes 3/6 FreeCodeCamp unit tests. Maybe we'll be able to finish this app by the end of the weekend!

In any case, the finish line isn't too far off. But for now, it's time to get some rest. See you tomorrow!
