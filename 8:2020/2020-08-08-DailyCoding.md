# Saturday August 8th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:57 -- Today was a decent day of coding. I continued to work on my URL shortener and made some decent progress on it.

In this evening's coding session I saved data to my database and learned about how to use MongoDB Cloud to see the data in my database (kind of like how I'm used to viewing the data in Parse Server).

I'd guess it'll probably be another 2-3 days for me to complete this project depending on how busy life is (I'll be moving apartments in the next couple days).

In any case, I'm tired. It's time to get some sleep. See you tomorrow!
