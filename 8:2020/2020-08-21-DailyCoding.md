# Friday August 21st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:04 -- Today was my one year anniversary of becoming a full-time software developer. Apart from that my day at the office was pretty unremarkable:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Pair programming to improve the stability of the credit card payment flow

LIstened to tech talks on SEO and UX/UI

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:25
Pair programming to improve the stability of the credit card payment flow

Notes:
Unit tests test each part of an application to see that the individual parts work correctly in
Isolation. Integration testing combines multiple parts of the application to see that they function
correctly together.
```

22:06 -- After work I also invested another hour or so into my professional development. I worked on my FreeCodeCamp exercise tracker (it now passes 4/6 unit tests), and finished reading and taking notes on chapter 6 of _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_.

22:08 -- Tomorrow I'll try to continue working on my FreeCodeCamp exercise tracker. Good night! :)
