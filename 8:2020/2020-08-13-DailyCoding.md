22:46 -- After work I also spent some time working on my FreeCodeCamp _Exercise Tracker_ project. Today I connected MongoDB to my project on Glitch, wrote a basic schema/model for the user, and then started working on the first post request.

Anyway, that's about all I have to report for today. See you tomorrow.
