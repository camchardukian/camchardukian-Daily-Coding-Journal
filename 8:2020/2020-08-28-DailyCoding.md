22:49 -- Today was my first time building our React Native app for Appcenter by myself.

I wouldn't say I'm an expert with the process yet, but I'm starting to get pretty comfortable with the basic flow.

After I came home for the night, I also spent about 40 minutes or so continuing to work though the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

Tonight I learned about and did challenges on HTTP Chai.

It looks like tomorrow I'll learn something about headless browsers.

We'll get to that tomorrow though. For now, it's time to get some sleep. See you tomorrow!
