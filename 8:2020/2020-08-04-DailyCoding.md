# Tuesday August 4th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:21 -- Today was another decent day at the office. Here's what I did:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Continued working on applying the high priority feedback fixes/improvements from the client

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:05
Finished working on applying the high priority feedback fixes/improvements from the client

Removed the “skip add video” button on the edit profile video page
```

23:22 -- After work I also spent about an hour continuing to work on my URL shortener project. I now understand how _dns.lookup()_ works in Node, but I need more time to research how to save data to my Mongo database.

Anyway, I'm beat. See you tomorrow.
