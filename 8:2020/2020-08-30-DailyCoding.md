# Sunday August 30th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

17:00 — Today I continued working through the FreeCodeCamp Quality Assurance curriculum. Tonight was my first time working with headless browsers. In particular, I gained a little bit of experience working with [Zombie.js](https://github.com/assaf/zombie).

One thing I learned tonight was that end-to-end (e2e) tests are used to test the end user’s experience by simulating the behavioral flow of the application from start to finish to ensure everything works as expected.

While I’d heard of e2e testing in the past, this is the first time I’ve spent some time researching what the term actually means.

It seems like with Zombie.js we can write e2e tests to enter values into forms and have the forms submit the data to APIs.

Of course, I’m sure the functionality of Zombie.js and e2e testing in general extends far beyond this. This is just what I’m doing tonight! :D

20:35 — Well, I finished the _Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai_ section of the FreeCodeCamp _Quality Assurance Certification_.

Tomorrow I’ll start working on the Advanced Node and Express section of the curriculum. I’m not sure how challenging this next section of the curriculum will be, but I imagine I’ll be able to complete it in the next week or so.

Now I’ll spend a little bit of time continuing to read through _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_.

21:33 -- I just finished taking notes on chapter 7 -- _Sharing Role Behavior with Modules_. I pushed my [notes for this chapter here](https://github.com/camchardukian/Software-Development-Book-Notes/tree/master/Practical%20Object-Oriented%20Design%20In%20Ruby).

In any case, I'm going to get some rest now. We've put in a pretty decent effort of additional weekend learning today :D

Let's get dinner and regroup for the upcoming week now. See you tomorrow!
