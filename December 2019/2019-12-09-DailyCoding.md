# Monday December 9th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:49 -- Well, today we got back on the grind. I spent almost 9.5 hours engaged with code today. Working with modals, and forms a lot this last week has really strenghtened my knowledge of data flow in React, props, and Redux-Form.

21:51 -- Anyway, here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
