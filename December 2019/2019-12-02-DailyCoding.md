21:49 -- While I'm still very junior, I'm starting to feel more confident in my abilities as a ReactJS developer.

Today I was able to support the intern in completing their task, and was also able to help him understand how to use mapStateToProps.

I'm starting to finally feel like I deserve to be a junior developer.

21:53 -- With over 9.5 hours of code related work today, I'm feeling pretty tired now. See you tomorrow!
