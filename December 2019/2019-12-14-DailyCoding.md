# Saturday December 14th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:05 -- Today was a day of mostly relaxing after a solid week of work. While I'm not working ridiculous hours anymore, I'm still working 50+ hours a week.

For that reason, after teaching English in the morning on weekends I sometimes like to take the rest of the day off to recharge. 

Anyway, because I didn't do any notable coding work today, there's not much for me to note in this entry. See you tomorrow!
