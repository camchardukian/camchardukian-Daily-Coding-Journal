# Sunday December 8th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

Today was another day of mostly recovery. I taught some English classes, but apart from that,today was more of a day for gathering up energy to prepare to get back on the grind tomorrow.

Tomorrow I'll hopefully have some more exciting things to report.

See you then!
