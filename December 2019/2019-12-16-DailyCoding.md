# Monday December 16th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:07 -- I'm dealing with a bit of a personal issue in my life today so I'm going to make this journal entry a quick one.

Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
8:15 - 11:45
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Set-up Slack account

Resolved the forgot password failed ticket.

Started working on redesigning the followed companies page.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 -17:45
Finished the new design for the followed companies page.

Resources:
How to make a div take up the remaining height: https://www.whitebyte.info/programming/css/how-to-make-a-div-take-the-remaining-height

(I like the Flexbox column/flex-grow method described in the above article) 

Notes:
We can add styles to multiple CSS classes at once by using a comma in between each class declaration.

Using line-heights often makes more sense than using fixed heights because fixed heights generally do a poor job of accounting for content of different lengths while line-heights are apt for this purpose.
```

21:09 -- Unfortunately, I have to be brief today. I have something urgent to take care of right now. We'll hopefully have more detailed thoughts available tomorrow.

In general though, today was a solid day as far as coding goes. See you tomorrow!
