Summary:
```
22:52 -- As you can see, there wasn't a whole lot of variety in my work today. I spent most of today working with Redux-Saga, and with modals from MaterialUI.

I'm starting to get a lot more comfortable with making reusable components, but I've still got some things to learn before I'd call myself an expert ;)

22:53 -- In any case, I'm going to get some rest now. See you tomorrow.
