# Saturday December 7th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:55 -- Today was a day of recovery. All in all this week, I did about 40.25 hours of work at the office and about 3.25 hours of extra learning on my own time.

Apart from that, this week I also passed 1,400+ lifetime hours of coding between my 9-5 job, and independent learning hours.

My skills are getting better each week. Let's keep developing and striving to become both a better person and a better developer each week! :D
