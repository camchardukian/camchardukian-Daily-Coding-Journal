Caught up on Slack/email

Worked on some bug fixes regarding the company register flow, and the student home page + followedCompanies page.

Lunch/nap

12:45 - 17:40
Updated logos on student/company register pages, added strict character limits to add credit card fields.

Started working on the companyDetail updated design.

Notes:
If we delete direct messages on Slack, the messages are deleted from both our inbox and the other personâ€™s inbox.
```
18:58 -- My team has a deadline for our project coming up in one more week. I'll probably be pretty busy at work until then, but hopefully in January I'll have more time for some side projects.

Anyway, I'm going to get some exercise and get dinner. See you later!
