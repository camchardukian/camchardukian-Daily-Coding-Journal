# Saturday December 28th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

Today was mostly a recovery day. I did teach some English classes, however, to finish the day a richer man than when I started it.

This weekend I'm mostly focused on planning my first international exotic vacation in  a couple years, reflecting on successes and failures from the past year, and preparing to buy a new phone to produce higher quality videos on.

However, I did see today that this year I put over 1,200 hours into improving my skills as a developer this year (counting office hours and independent learning hours).

That's pretty good considering I only spent about 1/3 of the year working as a developer full-time.

In 2020, however, maybe I'll be able to double that for 2,400 hours bettering my skills. Time will tell!
