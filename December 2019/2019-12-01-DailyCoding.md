# Sunday December 1st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:32 -- Wow, this ended up being the first weekend since I became a developer that I didn't spend at least an hour practicing code.

With that being said, I did check my time logs. Over the last 100 days or so, I've put a WHOPPING 682 hours into learning code either at the office or learning on my own time.

I've made massive amounts of progress over the last 3 months or so. It's been good to take a moment to appreciate my progress this weekend.

After a cash flow positive weekend thanks to my English classes, I'm now ready to get back on the coding grind tomorrow.

Let's do it!
