# Sunday December 22nd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:49 -- As expected, I really didn't put any time into coding today. Today was a good day, however, in that I did some cardio exercise (1.5 hours of juggling), and I learned a new breathing exercise.

I want to incorporate more deep breathing into my life to combat stress, and anxiety.

In any case, I'm going to get some rest and hopefully feel ready to get back on the grind tomorrow!
