# Friday December 13th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:54 -- It's super late. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
8:15 - 11:45
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

End-of-sprint meeting/demos

Started working on the new design for the student change password page.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 -17:55
Completed the new design for the student change password page.

Notes:
It’s intelligent to add padding-bottom to even the bottom of our page’s container in our application because then the application/page will be more visually appealing on even small screen sizes/browser windows.

We can use a template literal in our JSX

{`Text for line 1 is here
            And you can continue with the next line here`}

along with “white-space: pre-line” in CSS to ensure that our text will appear in a specific line arrangement “a” appears on line 1, “bc” on line 2, “d” on line 3, etc.

The nice thing about the above approach is that it allows us to ensure the text will appear on specific lines without having to set a width or maximum width on our container.

While I’m not yet sure of the possible SEO repercussions, many developers prefer to steer away from using “h” and “p” tags because those tags have pre-assigned margins.

23:55 -- Today I mostly focused on executing perfect pixel designs from Zeplin. If you read the notes above, you'll see some of the lessons I learned. Now, I'm going to push this journal entry to GitHub before midnight so I can continue the successful streak of this daily coding journal.
