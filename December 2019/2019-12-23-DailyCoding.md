19:29 -- We got back on the grind today. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Improved the UI of the add credit card page.

Started updating the design for the credit card list page.

Lunch/nap

12:45 - 18:40
Implemented a confirmation dialog popup when users attempt to delete one of their credit cards.

Also finished applying the new design for the credit card list page.

End-of-year self-evaluation.

19:32 -- With about 9.5 hours invested into coding/professional development related activities today, I'm feeling a little tired.

But, today was doable and the amount of fatigue I experienced today was very managable.

Strictly from a technical perspective, today was pretty interesting because I got to read a bit of the Stripe documentation and better understand how Stripe works.

19:34 -- In another week or two I'll have a meeting to assess how I've performed since joining the company.

I hope they recognize all the hard work I've put in to better myself as a developer!

19:35 -- I'm going to try to get some exercise. I've been sitting all day so it's time to get a little movement in. See you tomorrow!

17:38 -- I just noticed that today was the day I hit 1,500 total lifetime hours invested into code. We've come a long way! :D
