# Friday December 6th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:42 -- I almost forgot to write this journal. This week I've been focusing on my social life and improving my social skills because I think communicative abilities and the skill of being tactful are extremely underrated attributes for develoeprs.

But anyway, no worries about almost forgetting. Like everyday since I've become a full-time developer. Here's my end of day report! :D
```
8:30 - 11:45
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Continued working on CompanyVideoList

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:35
Continued working on CompanyVideoList (focused on making modal more responsive, and “hard-coding” functionality.

Notes:

When using Redux-Form, we may experience full-page refreshing or other strange bugs if we do not use the exact prop names “onSubmit” and “handleSubmit”.
```
23:44 -- This week I had the opportunity to practice developing the front-end of an application that did not yet have the back-end functionality implemented.

This was a unique challenge because it forced me to think about things more from a back-end perspective, and think about how they would structure the APIs rather than simply being able to look at their source code and backwards engineer it.

Now, I need to get to bed to prepare for tomorrow. I'm hoping to get some rest, and then maybe do a little extra coding practice tomorrow. See you then!
