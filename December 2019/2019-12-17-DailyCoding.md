# Tuesday December 17th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:04 -- Well, I got my personal issue from yesterday solved. I also had a solid day of work at the office. Here's what I got done:
```
9:00 - 11:45
Caught up on Slack/email

Completed the new design for the student home page.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 18:15
Completed the new design for the signup/role selection page.

Resources:

Notes:
The “nth-of-type” selector examines the sequential occurrence of an element/class within a common parent.
```
21:05 -- Today was a fairly light day of work (though still 8+ hours). However, considering I started my day 1 hour late and I'm going to bed one hour earlier than normal, I'm pretty content with how today played out.

Today was another day of practicing pixel perfect design. Today I became much more comfortable with doing CSS directly in React using Material UI's withStyles higher order component.

21:09 -- The design work this week has been a nice break from the intensive logic I'd been working on recently. It's great to have the opportunity to work on different types of problems to become a more well rounded developer.

In any case, however, it's time to get some sleep!
