# Monday December 30th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:10 -- Today was a fairly easy day at work. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Read JS documentation and worked on algorithms

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 18:10

Project demo and meeting

New project onboarding

Some UI fixes on the new project I joined

Notes:
It seems there isn’t a simple way, if any to prematurely break out of forEach loops in JavaScript.

Time complexity basically refers to how long it takes for an algorithm to run under a worst-case scenario while space complexity essentially refers to how much working memory/storage and algorithm will require to process under a worst-case scenario.

The sort() method in JavaScript mutates our original array. One way of avoiding this would be to use the slice method to make a copy of our array, and then use sort on the “copy” of our array, thus preserving the original array as-is.

‘!!’ Isn’t a typo. It’s actually used to coerce a truth/falsy value into being strictly true/false.

The some() Array Method can be used to test whether at least one item in an array meets some condition we’ve defined.

Semantic UI is a development framework we can use to more easily create beautiful responsive websites.

23:14 -- I'm exhausted now. Catch up with you tomorrow!
