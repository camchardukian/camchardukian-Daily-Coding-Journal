# Wednesday December 18th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:27 -- Today was a pretty good day. I got several hours of exercise in, and I had a mostly successful day at the office. Here are my notes from today:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Starting updating the design and restructuring the forgot password feature from consisting of two components to being a single component.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 -17:45
Finished the forgot password task from the morning

Fixed a bug on the student home page that led to a company’s current “followed” status not being immediately updated if the company was unfollowed on the followed companies list page.

Notes:
If there is no API call, Sagas are unnecessary — We can simply rely on actions and reducers.

When setting background colors for an entire page, it can be useful to also set “min-height: 100VH”.
```
22:32 -- Let's get some rest, and then do everything over again tomorrow!
