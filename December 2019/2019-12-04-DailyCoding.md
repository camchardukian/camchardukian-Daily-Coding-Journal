# Wednesday December 4th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:33 -- Today was another pretty good day. I spent most of the day working with Material UI and Redux-Saga again.

I feel like things are finally starting to "click". Given that I've put in roughly ~700 hours of practice into developing my skills over the last 3.5 months, these improvements should come as no surprise.

At the same time, it's great to feel all the things I've learned coming together to enable me to start producing enterprise level code on a semi-independent basis.

Anyway enough of the blibber-blabber. Here's a quick recap of my day at the office today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Continued working on companyVideoList UI

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:25

Continued working on CompanyVideoList

Fixed a bug in the company sign-up/login flow.

Notes:

We can select placeholders in css using ::placeholder.

While both are “falsy” values, false and undefined are also differs.

To pass values to the function called from our event handlers, we can use arrow functions. One potential issue to note about this, however, is that it may result in extra re-rendering.

// We can create a variable/prop/state to track the user’s entry point into the modal.
// If the user opens the modal by clicking the edit button, we can update the variable to ‘edit’.
// If the user opens the modal by clicking the add link button, we can update the variable to  ‘create’
// When we submit the form, we’ll choose to dispatch the correct action based upon the variable’s status.

The above was pseduocode for a problem I’m currently dealing with. (I later talked it over with my team lead, and decided it would be more simple just to use a hidden Redux field, and check whether there was an existing videoId already in the Redux store, and based on that I could decide which action to dispatch when the form was submitted)
```
22:38 -- It's getting late now, and I already skipped the gym today so I'm going to get to bed now so that I don't skip it again tomorrow.
