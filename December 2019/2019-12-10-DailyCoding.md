# Tuesday December 10th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:32 -- Like yesterday, today was a solid day of work. Here's what my day at the office looked like:

Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Fixed some bugs for improved functionality on the company media page (edit function, and create function).

Lunch/nap

12:45 - 6:30

Notes:
```
22:36 -- Today I learned a bit about the difference between shallow copies and deep copies of objects/arrays, etc.

Apart from that, today was mostly your average solid day at work.

I'm going to get some rest, and get back on the grind again tomorrow.
