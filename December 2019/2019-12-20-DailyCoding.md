# Friday December 20th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:09 -- Friday was the day I finally crashed. After 4 months on the grind, I finally needed a break. After working 7 days a week for 99 or 100 days, I just needed some time off.

As such, I let me team lead know what was going on and took Friday afternoon off.

Here's what Friday morning looked like though:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Worked on add credit card updated design
```

As you can see by this commit date, I didn't actually write this entry on Friday. The streak of ~120 days without missing an on-time commit ended.

More importantly, however, I'm trying to refresh myself a bit this weekend so that when Monday comes around I'll be ready to go again.
