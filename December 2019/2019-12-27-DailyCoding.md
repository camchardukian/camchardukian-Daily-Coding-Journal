# Friday December 27th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:18 -- I was a bit tired today because yesterday I was out late socializing. As a result, I worked a bit of a shorter day today.

Fortunately, today was a pretty light day of work because we finished the project we were working on yesterday and half of today was spent on end-of-sprint meetings.

I also spent some time learning the basics of TypeScript, and solving algorithms today.

I'm not sure how much coding I'll get done this weekend. I'm currently trying to make travel plans for the holidays and possibly buy a new phone to record higher quality YouTube videos on.

In any case, I'll let you know tomorrow if I get any additional coding in!
