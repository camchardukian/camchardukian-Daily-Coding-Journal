# Thursday December 19th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:13 -- Today was a decent day at the office, but if I'm being honest, I'm feeling pretty burnt out this week. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Fixed some bugs regarding the student change password page.

Started working on the new design/flow for company change password

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 17:15

Finished the company password new design/flow.

Started working on the new design for the add credit card popup

Notes:
We do not always have to checkout from origin, or origin/develop. If we want to make a copy of one of our feature branches, for example, “feature/REM-304”, we can checkout directly and make a new branch from inside the “feature/REM-304” branch.

We can delete multiple branches with one command using “git branch -D branch-name (space) branch-name2 (space) another-brrraannnchhh-name
```
20:16 -- In any case, I'm going to try to get away from the computer now and get some rest.
