# Wednesday December 25th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:43 -- Today was a solid day at the office. I worked mostly with CSS/SCSS today as I spent the day updating the designs of existing features rather than building new features from scratch or fixing bugs.

Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Continued updating the design on the companyMedia page.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 17:30
Finished the majority of the companyDetail updated design.

Notes:
If we want to “get rid of the existing values” of one of the direction attributes on an absolutely positioned element we can give that direction a value of unset. For example, left: unset.

There is a plus button inside of the Google Chrome inspector inside of the styles tab near the “hov” toggle element state button and the “.cls” element classes button.

By clicking on this plus icon we can instantly access the class of the element we have selected and begin applying class-wide styles to it, even if we have not yet styled that class inside of our application’s CSS file yet.

A pica is a type of unit we can use in CSS. A pica or “pc” is equal to 12 points or “pt” units. 1 “pt” unit is equal to 1/72 of 1 inch.

20:45 -- Time to go do some exercise. To anyone reading this, Merry Christmas! :D
