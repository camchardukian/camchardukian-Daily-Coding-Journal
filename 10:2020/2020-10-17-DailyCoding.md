# Saturday October 17th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:51 -- I wasn't able to do anything related to code today as I had a large number of English classes to teach.

I expect I'll do little if anything related to code until next weekend as tomorrow I also have many English classes to teach, and the next several days off I'm taking some much needed time to recharge after having a pretty exhausting summer.

In any case, I need to get some sleep now. See you tomorrow!
