20:40 — At work my team has an old React Admin project we need to add some functionality too. For that reason, this weekend I’m going to spend some time researching and building a basic app with React Admin.

Tonight I’m going to go through Traversy Media’s [React Admin Crash Course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRmdj-HpJyE).

Here are my notes…

React Admin is a frontend framework for building B2B applications running in the browser.

We can use the [JSON Server library](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to quickly build a back-end with fake data for prototyping.

If we want to run multiple commands at the same time (such as running a client script and server script), we can do so with the help of the [concurrently library](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently).

The Datagrid in React Admin is basically the table of columns in our list.

JSON Server supports middleware, thus we can use HTTP headers with JSON server.

---

20:43 — Ehh… That video wasn’t as insightful as I expected it to be apart from some of the cool library/package suggestions.

I think I’ll get more value out of simply trying to build a simple React Admin app from scratch this weekend. Well, I’ll get to that tomorrow when my mind is a bit fresher..

For now, I’ll spend another 20-30 minutes reading _Pro Git_.

---

23:15 -- I ended up finishing reading and taking notes on the _Git and Other Systems_ chapter in _Pro Git_.

---

23:16 -- Now it's time to get some rest. See you tomorrow.
