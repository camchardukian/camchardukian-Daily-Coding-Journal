Notes:
```

20:27 -- Tonight I finally finished the absolutely MASSIVE chapter 7 of _Pro Git_ and pushed my notes to my _Software Development Book Notes_ repo. Tomorrow I'll start reading chapter 8 which is titled _Customizing Git_.

Tomorrow at my company we're also setting OKRs so one of my teammates and I may work together to build a small demo app utilizing GraphQL this quarter.

We'll talk more about that later though as we see how things shake out. In any case, it's time to call it a night. See you tomorrow!
