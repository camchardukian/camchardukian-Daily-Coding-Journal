# Saturday October 3rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

20:57 -- I taught some English classes in the morning, but didn't get around to doing any additional coding practice today.

I've been on a streak of several nights of bad sleep so lately I've just been exhausted upon getting home.

I'll try to address this with an early night of sleep tonight. In any case, see you tomorrow.
