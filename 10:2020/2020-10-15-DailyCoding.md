# Thursday October 15th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:53 -- Today was a solid day at the office. I felt like I got into a pretty good flow today and was able to solve almost every, if not every roadblock I ran into on my own.

Here's what my day looked like:

Started fixing the contact form bugs

11:45 - 12:45

21:55 -- After work I also spent about 30-35 minutes reading _Pro Git_. I think I can finish the book after one more session.
