23:36 -- I'm pretty exhausted. Apart from staying late at the company after work continuing to code, I also spent several hours at home planning a basic outline for a performance for my company's anniversary party.

We'll see how everything goes. For now, however, I'm absolutely beat. See you tomorrow.
