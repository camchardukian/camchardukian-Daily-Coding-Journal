# Wednesday October 7th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

20:00 -- Today was a solid day at the office. Here's what I did:

Notes:
```

20:01 -- After work I also spent about 30 minutes or so reading chapter 8 _Customizing Git_ in the _Pro Git_ book.

I learned a couple useful things like how to customize the default template commit message and how to configure the Git server in a way such that it will reject force pushes from contributors.

In any case though, I'm feeling pretty tired so I'm going to get some rest. See you later.
