# Saturday October 31st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

I didn't do much related to code today. I didn't sleep well last night so it was difficult for me to focus after my English classes as I was so tired.

Tomorrow I'll try to read the last several pages of _Pro Git_ and put up my last notes for that book.

Then, I'll start learning about something else in the coming weeks...
