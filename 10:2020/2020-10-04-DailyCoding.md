# Sunday October 4th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

Today was a solid day. I taught English for several hours in the morning, caught up on sleep a bit in the afternoon,
and then spent about 45 minutes studying code in the evening.

I continued to read _Pro Git_ and learned more about some useful tools tonight such as _git rerere_, _git bisect_, and _[git submodules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z4Cmhji_FQ)_.

If I'm not too tired after work tomorrow, I'll continue reading more about Git submodules.

In any case, it's about time to call it a night. See you tomorrow.
