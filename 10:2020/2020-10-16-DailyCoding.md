21:36 -- Today was my last day at the office for a while because I'll be off next week to try to refresh myself a bit. I've felt burnt out for a few months now so I'm trying to take better care of myself going forward.

This weekend I have many English classes to teach so I probably won't spend much time doing anything related to code.

In any case, I'll still try to stay consistent with these journal entries...

See you tomorrow.
