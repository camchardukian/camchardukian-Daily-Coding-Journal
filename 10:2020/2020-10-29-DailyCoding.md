# Thursday October 29th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:15 -- Today was an exploratory day at the office. Here's what I did:

```
8:30 - 11:45

Caught up on email/slack

Continued researching animations in React Native

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:45
Continued researching animations in React Native

Fixed a UI bug in the React Admin project

Notes:
```

23:16 -- I've gotten a lot more comfortwable with animations in React Native over the last few days.

I've enjoyed learning them, and could even see myself specializing in this area and becoming the "go-to" member for animations help in the future.

For now, however, I'm exhausted. See you tomorrow.
