# Friday October 2nd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:25 -- Today was a pretty heads down day at the office. I spent the day working with EJS (for the first time) as well as a lot of CSS.

Here's what my day looked like:

```
8:30 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on email/slack

Started updating contact form mobile and desktop views in a web app using EJS and CSS

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:30
Continued updating contact form mobile and desktop views in a web app using EJS

After work I had to help one of my loved ones with a personal issue of theirs so I wasn't able to do any additional coding related study after work.

I'll try to read for an hour or so tomorrow though. Good night!
