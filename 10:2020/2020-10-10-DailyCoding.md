23:06 -- Today was a solid day. In the morning I spent about 4 hours teaching English. In the evening I spent about 2.5 hours on getting a new React Admin project started. The repo (as of October 2020) is [here](https://github.com/camchardukian/react-admin-example).

23:10 -- Tomorrow I'll continue working on that project. See you then.
