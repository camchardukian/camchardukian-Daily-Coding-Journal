21:08 -- Today was a decent day. Here's what I did at the office:

Notes:
It is not possible to style the native radio buttons and checkboxes with CSS. We can get around this limitation by using a library such as MaterialUI or by hiding the native elements and using pseudoselectors to create new elements.
```

21:09 -- After work I also spent about 35 minutes continuing to read _Pro Git_. Today's reading was mostly about git submodules.

I found this chapter rather dry, but I feel learning about submodules helped broaden my Git knowledge as well as better understand the node modules conceptually as well.

In any case, it's time to call it a night. See you tomorrow.
