# Sunday October 11th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:32 -- I could have very easily skipped touching any code today. I went to sleep pretty late last night, and had English classes to teach all morning.

Despite this, I didn't make any excuses for myself. I spent about 2.25 hours today continuing to work on my React Admin example project.

Today I fully implemented two different resources. I also read some of the documentation to continue to deepen my knowledge of this library.

Finally, I briefly looked over the [React Final Form library](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form).

With all of that being the case, I'm pretty gassed now. I'm excited to get some rest. See you tomorrow.
