# Thursday November 14th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:01 -- Well, I don't want to jinx anything, but I'm no longer regularly worrying about getting fired from my job anymore. Next Friday will be the day that marks 3 months of me working full-time as a software developer.

23:03 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Refactored companyDetail PR

Refactored companyItem component for better reusability.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:20
Continued refactoring old code.

Started working on follow/unfollow feature on the CompanyDetail page.

Resources:
React Hooks Documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
WebP image format: https://css-tricks.com/using-webp-images/

Notes:
Hooks were a new addition to React in version 16.8. Hooks are backwards compatible.

We can use object-fit: cover in CSS to make a large image fill our div without stretching the imageâ€™s ratio.
```
23:11 -- While today didn't feel particularly productive as the majority of it was spent refactoring old code, I still put in nearly 9 hours of work, despite again feeling fatigued.

I also got to the gym early this morning. Come to think of it, I'm wondering if getting back in the gym has been related to my recent fatigue...

In any case, I've got to get to bed now. See you tomorrow.
