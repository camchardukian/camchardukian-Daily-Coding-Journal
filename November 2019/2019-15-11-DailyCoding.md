Notes:
We can use “destroyOnAmount” in ReduxForm to influence whether or not our form’s state in the Redux store should be automatically destroyed when our component unmounts. The default assigned value for this property is true.
```
21:15 -- I'm going to eat dinner, then get to bed. Hopefully by Sunday (the start of a new week), I can get back on the grind consistently coding outside of work like I was before.

Today, however, I was exhausted and couldn't get myself to put in the extra work. See you tomorrow.
