# Monday November 25th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:39 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Started working on the company profile page

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:50

Finished design of company profile page.

Had to toss the majority of the day’s work away due to receiving an updated design that’s almost completely different.

Started working on company profile new design.

Resources:
Material-UI tabs: https://material-ui.com/components/tabs/#tabs

Notes:
We should add all of our files to git before stashing them. Forgetting to do this will make our git stash basically useless (because the stash will be empty).
```
21:40 -- I worked pretty independently today, and got a first-hand glance at why in the early stages of working on a project it isn't necessary to do perfect pixel design.

The reason of course is because it is always possible for the client to change the design in the early stages of the project.

Thus, early on, we should focus more on the basic functionality and reusability of our code rather than trying to design everything perfectly.

21:42 -- It's getting late so I'm about to call it a day. Hopefully tomorrow I can continue to work fairly independently. See you then!
