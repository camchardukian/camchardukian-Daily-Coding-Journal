# Saturday November 23rd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:29 -- Today was a solid day of living a balanced life. I took a one day break from coding to go to the gym, each English, surprise the girl I'm seeing, and catch up with my family.

While I didn't have the chance to continue the React bootcamp today, I took care of every other area of my life today.

When I get back to work tomorrow, I expect to be rejuvenated and ready to learn. Until then, let's get some rest! :D
