22:11 -- After work, I spent some extra time learning about Redux-Form and Material UI.

After an early morning that started at the gym, and just under 9 hours of work today, I'm ready to go through my night routine and get some sleep.

22:15 -- While calculating the times below I noticed that I've now spent 1,300+ hours with code. That's pretty cool! I've come soooo, sooo far over this past year or so.

While sometimes I wish for the future to come quickly, I'd like to take at least one moment to be grateful for how far I've made it already!
