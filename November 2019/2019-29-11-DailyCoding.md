19:54 -- I tried to do some extra coding after work, but after the first 30 minutes or so I just felt really tired.

Luckily, I've already put in my 7 hours of coding for the week!

I'm going to try to take the rest of the night off, and then maybe continue "The React Bootcamp" course on Scrimba tomorrow. See you then!
