# Wednesday November 6th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:13 -- Today was a somewhat difficult day. I had to spend a lot of time debugging errors, and I got pretty confused because I was creating lots of columns and rows in Parse server for the first time.

In any case, with some help from my team members,I was able to finish the task I was working on. Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Started adding dynamic rendering on the followed companies page.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 6:00
Finished the followed companies page.

Resources:

Notes:

If you create a new provider folder, you need to remember to import it into the App.js file.

To view the documentation in our React app we can run ’npm run apidoc’, restart our backend (one example being ‘pm2 restart 0’), and then go to localhost:1337/apidoc (or whichever port and url is specified for hosting the API docs).
```
22:16 -- Each day I'm just trying to get better, learn new things, and make my GitHub portfolio more attractive.

We'll continue tomorrow, but for now, I need to get some sleep... Good night!
