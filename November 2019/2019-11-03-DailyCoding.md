# Sunday November 3rd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

19:34 -- I felt pretty stressed this afternoon, but spending an hour reading and taking notes about code somehow calmed me down. :)

I read and took notes on about 1.5 chapters of *The Art of Readable Code* and also add a *README* file to that repo. 

Now I'm getting ready to dinner, and then we'll try to get to sleep early and get ready for another week at the office tomorrow!
