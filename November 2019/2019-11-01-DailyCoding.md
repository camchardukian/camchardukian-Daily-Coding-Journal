# Friday November 1st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:57 -- It's getting late. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
8:20 - 11:45

Caught up on Chatwork/email

30 minutes or so working on the change password page (added the backbitten component)

End of sprint review , and division meetings.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:20

“Tech Talk” + more meetings.

Finished the change password feature draft (code may still need some refactoring).
```
22:58 -- If I spend at least 1 hour doing something coding related tomorrow, I'll achieve my goal of studying code at least 7 hours (an average of at least 1 hour per day) for this week.

Will I achieve my goal? Or will I let the very large audience reading these journal entries down? Find out in the next daily coding journal commit tomorrow! :D
