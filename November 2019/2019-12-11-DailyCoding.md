# Tuesday November 12th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:14 -- I was alright early this morning, but since an hour or so before lunch until now I've been absolutely mentally toasted.

Today I worked with Google Maps API. It was extremely challenging, which resulted in a level of mental strain and frustration that probably contributed to my exhaustion.

Anyway, here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Started working on Company Detail Google Maps integration

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:00
Continued working on Company Detail Google Maps Integration and dynamic rendering.

Notes:
Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates.
```
20:18 -- As I said already, I'm feeling pretty beat so we'll call it a night here, and hopefully come back stronger tomorrow.
