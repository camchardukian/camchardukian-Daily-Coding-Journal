# Tuesday November 19th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:49 -- I'm feeling a bit tired. With that being said, today was the first time in several days that I put in extra time improving my skills as a developer outside of my 9-5 job.

Today after work I put about 45 minutes or so of extra time sharpening my skills.

While I'd say I'm not feeling super energetic, I also didn't feel "beat down" today, which is an improvement over how I've felt most of the past week.

In any case, here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Finished fixing followedCompanies page pagination.

Continued working on company register page.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:55
Finished part I of the company register page and started working on part II.

Notes:
Top-level domains are basically the extensions we use at the end of our domain names. For example, ‘.com’, ‘.edu’, etc.

We can delete rows in Parse server by clicking the checkbox for that/those row(s) of data, clicking edit, and then selecting delete this/these row(s).

21:52 -- I'm feeling pretty tired and I intend to go to the gym before work tomorrow so I'm going to call it a night now. Cheers!
