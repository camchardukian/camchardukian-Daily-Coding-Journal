# Sunday November 17th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:03 -- Today was mostly the same as yesterday. I taught English for 4 hours in the morning and then spent the rest of the day resting and relaxing.

I also got in a gym workout before the English classes this morning. While I didn't do any extra coding this weekend, I do feel somewhat less stressed.

I also managed to make this a cash positive weekend thanks to the English teaching.

Overall, I'm satisfied with how this weekend went. Tomorrow I'll get back to the 9-5 grind and strive to keep my stress levels at a managable level so I can regain my ability to spend extra time coding outside of work hours.
