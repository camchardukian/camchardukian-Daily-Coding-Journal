# Tuesday November 26th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:26 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Continued working on the company profile page

11:45 - 1:45
Lunch/nap

1:45 - 6:45
Finished rough draft of the company profile page

Resources:

Notes:
We can use negative margins, plus a border on a child element that is the same color as the rest of the page combined with a negative margin to effectively “erase” the parent div’s border.
```

20:28 -- I just finished watching a video from Scrimba's *The React Bootcamp* course. Unfortunately, I couldn't completely follow along with the exercises because I seemed to be getting some errors with Scrimba itself.

In any case, I'm going to take notes on a video about Render Props, and then call it a day.

## Render Props Part 1:
-- In this video, the instructor basically did some "pre-teaching" of render props by reminding us how callback functions work, and how we may need to use *e* or *event* when defining parameters inside of functions we pass to event listeners.

20:35 -- In any case, I've put over 9 hours of work in today. Let's eat something, and relax a little bit before bed. Tomorrow we'll work hard again at the office, and try to learn more about *Render Props* after work.
