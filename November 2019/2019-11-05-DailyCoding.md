# Tuesday November 5th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:38 -- Work was pretty exhausting today. I spent most of the day pairing with another developer trying to get the MaterialUI *Popper* component working properly in our project.

I legitimately think that with as many hours as it took for us to come up with a solution, we could have just programmed the entire thing using CSS from scratch.

I recently watched [an episode of *Self Taught or Not*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf8YQQyeevM) that was talking about pretty much the same idea.

Instead of being reliant and spending time trying to hack together a solution using some libraries, just spend the time building from scratch and you'll become a more competent developer that is then no longer reliant on these tools.

In any case, here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Continued working on the followed companies page UI.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:45
Finished followed companies page static UI, so that tomorrow I can add dynamic rendering.

Resources:
Popper Material UI: https://material-ui.com/components/popper/

Notes:

The default background for elements in CSS is actually NOT white. It’s transparent!

Therefore, if we have a fixed footer or navigation that we want to “cover” or display completely over the rest of the content on the page, we actually need to explicitly give our elements a background color of white (or any color for that matter).
```
22:48 -- Like I said, I'm pretty exhausted. I'm going to push this journal entry to GitHub and then get some rest.

P.S. I just noticed that today I hit 1,200 of lifetime hours working as a software developer/ studying code independently! We should be able to get to 1,500+ hours by the end of 2019! :D
