# Monday November 11th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:30 -- I'm feeling pretty soul crushingly tired now. Ok, maybe that was a bit dramatic, but I am exhausted.

This morning I woke up at 6:30 a.m. to hit the gym before work and then I spent 8 hours working on the company's clock, and another extra hour on my own time to improve my skills.

Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Refactored code from followedCompanies PR

Started working on CompanyDetail page UI

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 6:10
Continued working on the Company Detail Page and finished rough draft of UI (excluding Google Maps integration).

Notes:

TakeLatest, and TakeLeading in Redux-Saga are different because while TakeLatest only “changes state in the reducer” based on the most recently made API call (if many API calls are made before the first one returns a response), TakeLeading takes the first API call and blocks any additional calls from being made until a response is returned.
```
20:34 -- Anyway, I'm pretty mentally drained at this point. But... I did get 9 hours of work in plus a gym workout. That's a very solid day. Let's get some rest, and continue the journey tomorrow. :)
