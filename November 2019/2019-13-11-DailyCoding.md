# Wednesday November 13th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal
19:43 -- Like the last few days, I'm dealing with some fatigue. I've been thinking about taking a couple days off within the next sprint or two to relax.

10 straight weeks of 7 days a week 55-60 hours of work every week will do that to you I guess. On the bright side, my skills have improved an ASTRONOMICAL amount over the last few months.

In any case, today I'll spend maybe 30-45 minutes doing FreeCodeCamp exercises. I'm trying to get to bed early tonight as tomorrow I'll go to the gym before work.

20:22 -- According to [this lesson on FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react/render-react-on-the-server-with-rendertostring), we can use the *renderToString()* method
```
// full code
ReactDOMServer.renderToString()
```
to render a React component on the server.

Using this method may create a faster initial load experience for users as well as make one's website/application more easily crawled by search bots.

20:28 -- I just finished the rest of the standalone React exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Next,I'll take a quick break for dinner and then finish the 6 or 7 Redux exercises I have remaining.

21:28 -- I just finished some of the Redux exercises. It looks like I still have around 3 left. But, let's call it a night, eat a little bit more, and get to sleep so we can rise early for the gym tomorrow.

20:40 -- Oh, I forgot to include my notes from the office. Here they are:
