# Saturday November 30th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:43 -- Today was mostly a day away from code to recharge. This morning I hit the gym and worked at the English center for some extra cash for my long-term savings.

Most of the rest of the day I caught up on sleep and spent relaxing with my girl.

This week I successfully averaged 1+ hour of daily coding outside of my day job. Let's aim to achieve the same in the coming week! :D
