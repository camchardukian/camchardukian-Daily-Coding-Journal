# Thursday November 7th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:37  -- Today was one of the most frustrating days I've ever had at the office. I spent the entire day working on implementing pagination on some list page I built.

It felt super difficult, and I needed a lot of help from the other developers on my team to complete it.

In fact, here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Started adding pagination to the followedCompanies page

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:45
Finished adding pagination to the followedCompanies page + other small fixes.

22:40 -- I felt so frustrated and depleted by the end of the day. But, I funneled that frustration as motivation to improve myself.

I spent nearly 2 hours outside of my standard office hours improving myself.

I finished reading and taking notes on *The Art of Readable Code* today, did some extra work on my company's project, and did some React exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

22:42 -- My goals for the rest of the year are to complete FreeCodeCamp's front-end libraries certification (which includes building 5 projects using React), and to read and take notes on at least one software development book.

I'll spend this weekend finishing the rest of the React, Redux, and React/Redux exercises. I'll also aim to get started on building the first project, which will be a random quote machine.

But for now, it's getting late and I should get some rest for tomorrow.

Good night!
