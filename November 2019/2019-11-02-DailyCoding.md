# Friday November 1st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:42 -- Well, I've done it. Apart from working 40+ hours at my developer office job this week, I also just passed 7 hours of studying on my own time.

Today I spent some time reading and taking notes on *The Art of Readable Code*. I won't elaborate on that here as I already have a [separate GitHub repo](https://github.com/camchardukian/Software-Development-Book-Notes) where I post my notes from the software development books I have read.

Anyway, mostly this entry is just to log my time for today and confirm that yes, we hit our goal for the week! :D
