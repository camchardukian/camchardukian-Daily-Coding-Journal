# Monday November 18th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:09 -- Today was a bit of a challenging day at the office. I spent most of the day trying to diagnose, and fix a pagination error on one of the list pages I built.

It was mentally exhausting, but once again, I took it easy after work today. I think tomorrow may be the day I have enough energy to start coding outside of work again.

With that being said, I'm going to try to be mindful of not pushing myself into too deep a state of burnout.

The country I'm working in doesn't have extended time off for Christmas so it'll still be quite a while before I have an extended holiday to chill out.

Anyway, here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Adding new users to database

Tested followedCompanies page pagination

Started working on Company Register feature

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:10
Debugging followedCompanies page pagination

Resources:

Notes:
The safest way to create new entries in Parse Server database is via Postman. Creating entries directly can lead to us missing fields or certain relations.
```
21:17 -- Anyway, I'm going to eat dinner and call it a night. See you tomorrow!
