# Thursday November 21st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:43 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Continued working on company register page part II.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:50
Continued working on company register page part II.
```
22:44 -- If we're being honest, it wasn't a particularly exciting today.

I guess the only notable thing is that lately I've been feeling some self-doubt. I actually reached out to my team leader today after work to see if he had any advice or suggestions.

I know objectively that I've been getting better because I can look at past journal entries and see that things that would've seemed like insurmountable obstacles 2-3 months ago are now routine bug fixes for me.

Even with that being the case, it was good to hear reassurance from my team leader that my recent tasks have been more difficult.

I knew logically I wasn't stagnating, but it's always good to get out of our heads and get things off your chest with another person too.

In any case, it's about time for bed so I'll conclude this journal entry hear and see you tomorrow!
