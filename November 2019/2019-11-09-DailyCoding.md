# Saturday November 9th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:56 -- After waking up super early to go to the gym yesterday morning, and also waking up early this morning to teach English, my energy levels were a bit low.

For that reason, I made today more about focusing on getting some extra sleep and getting to bed early tonight to prepare for next week.

This week I spent about 8.75 hours learning code outside of work, which I'm very happy about considering I still teach English on the weekend.

Next week I'll strive to spend at least 7 hours outside of work bettering my skills. Let's try to make next week as successful as this week has been! :D
