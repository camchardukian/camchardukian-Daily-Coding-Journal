Dispatching actions from Saga: https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/basics/DispatchingActions.html

Notes:
â€” We can dispatch actions from inside of our Saga like so: 

    yield put({ type: ACTION_NAME_HERE,     dataParamsInfoOrAnotherName})
```
21:36 -- Apart from putting in 10+ hours of work today, I also went to the gym for the first time in who knows how long. I'm going to keep working hard so that this time next year I can either have a high paying office job, or a solid paying remote job.

That's more medium-term though. For now, let's just keep hustling and get through those React/Redux FreeCodeCamp exercises this weekend!
