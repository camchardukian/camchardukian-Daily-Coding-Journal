# Monday November 4th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:25 -- It's been another solid day. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Added changed password successfully page, and refactored code for changePassword feature.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:35
Finished refactoring code for changePassword feature

Started working on followedCompanies feature.

Resources:

Creating a div with the bottom half one color and the top half another color: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7842393/create-a-div-with-bottom-half-one-color-and-top-half-another-color

Notes:

— We can use empty tags <> </> as shorthand for React fragments.

— If our goal is to perform some “clean-up” actions in our React application, we should be cautious of relying on a confirm/ok button to perform said cleanup. This is because users could “get around” clicking our button by entering another URL. Thus, it often makes more sense to dispatch “clean-up” actions inside of our componentWillUnmount function.
```
20:28 -- Apart from the standard 9-5 grind, I also spent some extra time at the office today after hours working on a UI for my current task on Jira.

I also took notes on another couple chapters of *The Art of Readable Code*.

But this developer journey we're on is a marathon and not a sprint. It's time to push this entry to GitHub, get some exercise, and eat dinner before bed.
