# Saturday November 16th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:46 -- Today I mostly focused on chilling out. I've felt pretty stressed and just generally... out of it this week.

I'm hoping that taking it relatively easy this weekend (light to no coding, but still having to teach English 4 hours per day) will help me reduce my cortisol and relax a bit.

Tomorrow I'll probably do more of the same. Light to no coding, and just push another journal entry to GitHub.

Today was notable because I finally announced to my parents that I'm working full-time as a software developer.

While I'm not yet a "rockstar developer", I'm starting to feel like I actually am entitled to the title software developer now.

Anyway, I'm going to get dinner now, and get to bed early so that I can hit the gym tomorrow morning. Cheers!
