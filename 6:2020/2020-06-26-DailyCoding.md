# Friday June 26th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:24 -- Today was a pretty solid day of coding -- which is a huge relief as I feel like I've been struggling this week. Here's what I did today:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Finished a ticket about a bug in the signup process

Administrative paperwork

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 18:35
Fixed 5-6 files with conflicts in menteeâ€™s PR for react-native version 0.2 feedback.

Fixed other bugs in the React Native project

Resources:

Notes:
We can add an event listener to React Navigation to check when the page has changed. For
example:  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('blur', () => { }
```

23:26 -- Not only did I do an extra 1.5 hours of work for my company today, I also spent over an hour working on my pomodoro clock. And wow, I also realized I spent another hour planning an English lesson too.

Wow, today was a productive day!

My pomodoro clock can now start/stop, and loop from a session countdown to a break countdown and back indefinitely.

The next feature I'm planning to implement into my pomodoro clock is a reset button. But... that'll have to wait on hold as I need to get some beauty sleep!

Have a nice night ;). See you tomorrow.
