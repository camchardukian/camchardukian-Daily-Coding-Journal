# Tuesday June 9th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:21 -- Today was another MONSTER day of coding. I spent more than 12 hours on code related activities today! Here's what my day at the office looked like:

I also finished deploying my calculator project to GitHub pages with the help of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8s4Ng-re0E).

I also spent another few roughly 3 hours working on my calculator today. I'm SO close to being finished. My calculator passed 15/16 unit tests, and I'm well on my way to passing the last one as well.

I'm excited to be nearing the end of this project! :D

In any case, I'm exhausted. I'm going to get some rest and hopefully attack tomorrow with the same fervor I tackled today with.
