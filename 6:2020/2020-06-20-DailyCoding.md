# Saturday June 20th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:30 -- Today was a pretty nice day. I spent about 4.75 hours teaching English and another 1.75 hours working on my React TypeScript pomodoro clock.

23:31 -- During this project I ran into the same issue I had with my React TypeScript calculator. I set some state and I needed that state immediately to make some chance. Unfortunately, the state can not change quickly enough for the condition that follows to be accurately evaluated.

I'm not too sure how to go about solving this problem. I've tried _async await_, but thus far that has been pretty ineffective. I guess I'll just keep trying to find other possible solutions.

In any case, I'm exhausted. 6.5 solid hours of work isn't bad for a Saturday after a full week at the office.

See you tomorrow!
