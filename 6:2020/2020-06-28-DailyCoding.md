# Sunday June 28th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:19 -- While yesterday was a pretty forgettable day, today was a pretty great day! :D

In addition to teaching English for about 4 hours this morning, I also spent over 2 hours working on my pomodoro clock tonight.

I made a lot of progress tonight. In fact, I'm now pretty confident I'll finish this entire project in the next few days!

Well, if I'm not overly fussy about designing a beautiful UI hahaha. For learning purposes, however, I think just focusing on the core functionality is the most important part.

In any case, I'm doing pretty good today. This week I'm going to focus on getting more sleep as I think that'll help me code more productively, learn more quickly, and overall feel better about life.

With that being said, I'm out! See you tomorrow! :D
