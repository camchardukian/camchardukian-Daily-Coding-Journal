# Sunday June 14th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:08 -- Today was a fairly decent day of coding. I spent a little over 1.5 hours on code related activities today.

I implemented the basic UI skeleton for my pomodoro clock. I'm going to make tonight's report brief as I need to head home from the place I'm working and try to get some sleep before work tomorrow.

See you tomorrow.
