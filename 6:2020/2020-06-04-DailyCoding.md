# Thursday June 4th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:38 -- Man, I've felt really tired the last couple days. Today I felt totally burnt out. Here's what I did at the office today:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Tried to optimize rendering of React Native video

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:20
Fixed applicantDetail popup missing fields in admin project, and also fixed rendering of React
Video.

Started working on fixing the add/edit language screen bugs that occur if a user creates an
account without values on web and then tried to add/edit values on mobile.
