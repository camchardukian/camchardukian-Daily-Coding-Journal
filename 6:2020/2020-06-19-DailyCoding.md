23:44 -- Today was a pretty difficult day at work. Here's what I did:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

End-of-sprint meeting

Started working on fixing the apply job error popup

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:40
Continued solving all the bugs that could  potentially occur if the company adds/removes
questions while the student is in the process of answering questions in the job application flow.

Notes:
When working with values in the database, changing the values manually often doesnâ€™t work,because of factors like autogenerated IDs, etc.
```

23:46 -- That's all I'll note for tonight because I'm exhausted and I need to work tomorrow morning. Hopefully we'll get some time to work on our pomodoro clock tomorrow after the English classes.
