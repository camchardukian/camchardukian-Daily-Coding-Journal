Notes:
```

22:23 -- Today I felt a lot like a manager. Almost my entire day was spent reviewing the code of other team memebrs, mentoring other team members, and participating in meetings.

I did, however, spend almost 1.5 hours continuing to work on my TypeScript calculator after work, and made some decent progress.

22:25 -- Now it's getting late and I'm beat. See you tomorrow.
