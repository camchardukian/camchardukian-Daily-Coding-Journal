Notes:
```

I've been having some sinus problems lately. I'm not sure if this is due to the weather changing or me just being run down in general from working a lot.

Unfortunately, this has resulted in me really struggling with writing quality code at a decent pace this week.

I'm hoping that by getting a solid 9 hours of sleep tonight I'll be closer to my normal self tomorrow.

Perhaps I'll also try writing more pseudocode to ensure I truly understand the things I'm implementing rather than just trying to hack away at the keyboard and hope for the best.

See you tomorrow.
