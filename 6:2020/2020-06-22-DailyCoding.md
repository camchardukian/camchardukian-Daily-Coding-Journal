23:38 -- After work, I also spent about 1.5 hours working on my pomodoro clock and another 25 minutes or so reading _Practical Object-Oriented Design In Ruby_.

Now, however, it's getting late so I'm going to get to bed and try to charge up for tomorrow.

I expect tomorrow's task to be pretty challenging, but there's nothing else I can do to prepare now except for get some deep sleep. Sounds like a nice plan to me!

See you tomorrow.
