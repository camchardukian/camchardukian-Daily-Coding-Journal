# Tuesday June 23rd 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:07 -- Today was a solid day at the office. Here;s what I did:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Moved followed companies from bottom tab to account settings

OKR meeting with mentee

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:55
Started working on real time notifications counter, but then discussed with team lead
and realized this task was blocked and that it was better to wait for another team member
to finish the first part of the task before I implemented the counter.

Start fixing the UI on the edit profile view, and edit profile step 1 screens. Also nearly finished
Refactoring the SelectDayMonthYear component.

Resources:
React Navigation Bottom Tab Navigator:

Notes: I think it may be better to let the mentee lead the mentee/mentor meeting rather than myself because doing so will naturally provide better insights into their thought processes, and shine light on what challenges or issues are most important to them at the time.
```

23:12 -- After work I spent a little bit of time researching about recursion. I also put in an extra 50 minutes or so at the office today to make extra progress on my task.

I've come down with a little bit of a cold today, however, so going past 9 hours of software related work just wasn't in the cards today.

On the bright side, I was able to get in some exercise for the first time in over a week since injuring my foot last week.

In any case, I'm beat. Bedtime is calling, and I'm ready to answer. See you later!
