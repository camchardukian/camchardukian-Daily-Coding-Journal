# Sunday June 21st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:19 -- This morning I taught English for about four hours. In the evening, I also spent another hour or so reading and learning about dependencies.

I also spent some time studying Vietnamese words related to the software development industry, but I won't include that in my time spent practicing code outside of work.

In any case, tomorrow we're back to the grind. See you then...
