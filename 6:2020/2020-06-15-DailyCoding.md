# Monday June 15th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

21:52 -- Man oh man, I feel burnt. Today was a pretty rough day. I don't know If I didn't sleep well last night, if wasting a few hours on social media yesterday fried my brain, if I'm burnt out, or if I'm just having difficulty focusing because of other personal issues.

In any case, today was a pretty off day. Here's what I did at the office:

```

```

21:57 -- Today was my 200th day (not including weekends or other days off) as a software developer! A lot of progress has been made over those 200 days.

While there's still a long way to go, let's conclude this difficult day by at least acknowledging and being appreciative of how far we've already come. :-)
