# Wednesday June 17th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:29 -- I was a little tired today because I was up late last night dealing with some personal issues.

Now that they are dealt with, however, I'm feeling a lot less burnt out than the last couple days.

Anyway, here's what I did at the office today:

```
10:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting // of course I didnâ€™t attend because I arrived late this morning.

Caught up on Slack/email

Started fixing some formatting errors, and added some missing information in the React Native
project job detail page.


11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 18:40
Finished fixing some formatting errors, and added some missing information in the React Native
project job detail page.

Fixed some bugs with the applicant detail popup in the ReactJS admin project.

Administrative paperwork

Fixed formatting of name fields in the React Native project.

Fixed language rendering logic in application detail popup

Notes:
```

23:31 -- I also spent about an hour working on my pomodoro clock tonight implementing React Context and adding incrementing/decrementing buttons to control the session and break lengths.

23:32 -- I'm exhausted. I hurt my foot a couple days ago so it's difficult to walk. Tomorrow morning I'll have to clean it up again and take it easy on my commute to work so I'll have to get up early tomorrow morning.

So, let's call it a wrap for tonight and get some rest!
