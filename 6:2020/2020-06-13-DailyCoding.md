# Saturday June 13th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:09 -- It's been an amazing week. This week I got 70+ productive hours of work in for the 1st time since I started logging every hour of my life more than 4 years ago.

Of those 70 productive hours, about 58.5 of them were related to software (the other 11 or so were my English teaching job on weekends).

The "strangest" part? I've had so much fun this week while working a crazy schedule! Dare I say I wish every week were like this :p

In any case, today I read another 10 or so pages of Sandi Metz's _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_. I also spent some time architecting and initing my next FreeCodeCamp project (the Pomodoro Clock).

All of this of course was in addition to the 5 hours or so I spent teaching English this morning.

I hope I can make next week as amazing as this week has been! :D
