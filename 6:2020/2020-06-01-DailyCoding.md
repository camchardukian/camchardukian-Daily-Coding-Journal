# Monday June 1st 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:57 -- I'm exhausted. I had a full day at the office today, was well as almost 1.5 hours trying to debug my TypeScript calculator. Here's what my full day at the office looked like:

```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Researched Firebase Cloud Messaging

Completed several old JIRA tickets.

Guided mentee how to add a thumbnail to the videos in React Native video.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:15
Helped mentee setup ESLint in her project.

Reviewed mentee’s pull request.

Fixed a bug on the applicationList page.

Headless JS: https://reactnative.dev/docs/headless-js-android

The difference between CreateRef and UseRef:
https://blog.bitsrc.io/react-useref-and-react-createref-the-difference-afedb9877d0f

Notes:
(0 == “”) evaluates to true in JavaScript because both 0 and “” evaluate to falsy. In TypeScript,
however, string == number or string === number are both compile time errors.

Headless JS is a way for us to run JavaScript code while our app is in the background.
CreateRef should be used with class components while UseRef should be used inside of functional components.
```

23:58 -- Good night!
