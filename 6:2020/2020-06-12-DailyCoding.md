23:43 -- I feel as if my abilities as a developer have increased recently. After finishing the calculator, I'm a lot more confident in my ability to see small side projects to their conclusion on my own.

Starting to read _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_ has also been beneficial for two reasons.

The first of course is that as I read further and further into this book I'll be exposed to more and more design principles and improve my ability to architect software.

More surprising, however, is that reading this book along with listening to _Amusing Ourselves to Death_ on Audible have combined to super charge my motivation and concentration this week.

I'm feeling great about the future right now. Not because I'm already entitled to positive future events, but because I'm gaining a lot of confidence in my ability to work hard to help manifest them.

I didn't do much side coding when I came home today because I already spent an extra 1.5 hours at the office and I also needed to spend 2 hours to create some new games for my ESL classes and plan tomorrow's lessons.

Actually, now I need to get ready for bed so that I'm not tired tomorrow. Good night!
