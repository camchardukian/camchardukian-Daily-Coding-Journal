23:36 -- Tonight was also great because I finally finished my React TypeScript calculator! I also updated the [GitHub Pages site displaying it here](https://camchardukian.github.io/fcc-react-typescript-calculator/)!

Finally, I read the 1st chapter of Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby. I'm enjoying the book so far and hope to finish it in the next 3 weeks or so.

Now... I'm ready for bed after all the hustling today. I'm going to get some rest. See you tomorrow! :)
