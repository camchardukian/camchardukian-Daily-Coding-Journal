23:23 -- Apart from my day at the office, I also did some good work when I came home today. I seem to have almost finished my React TypeScript calculator.

All the outputs are correct when I manually test it, but I still fail some of the automated unit tests for some reason.

I also learned a bit about how to deploy a GitHub repo to GitHub pages and read the introduction of _Sandi Metz's Practical Object Oriented Design In Ruby_ book.

In other words, today was a pretty packed day. I hope I can learn some more cool things tomorrow! :D
