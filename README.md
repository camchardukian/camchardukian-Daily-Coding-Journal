# Daily Coding Journal
This daily coding journal is used for retention and accountability purposes. By writing about
whatever I'm learning on a given day, I expect to be able to internalize more of the software
development concepts I'm exposed to each day. This journal also helps hold me accountable
in sitting down everyday to ensure I'm learning something new, and putting in the time
necessary to master my craft.

Note: This journal was maintained from April 2019 to December 2020. If you're interested in what I've been doing in more recent years, feel free to check out [my other repos](https://github.com/camchardukian?tab=repositories) and my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-chardukian/).
