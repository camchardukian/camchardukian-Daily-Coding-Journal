# Sunday April 26th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:16 -- Today was a decent day. I spent a few hours today reading, and taking notes on *The Beginner's guide to OKR*. I also took those notes, and updated my *Software Development Book Notes* GitHub repo with them.

I consider this as time spent improving my abilities to function as an effective software developer in a team so I am counting this towards the amount of time I've spent improving my craft outside of work.

That little "disclaimer" aside, tomorrow I'm back to the office. Vietnam has done a great job of handling the Corona virus.

It was fun working remotely for a month and I learned a lot. For now, however, I'm excited to get out of the house and start collaborating more closely with other more experienced software developers once more.
