23:37 -- Man it's crazy that we're halfway through April already.

I've been working from home for 2.5 weeks already. There's some ups and downs to working from home, but I generally prefer it and intend to WFH in the long-term.

With that being said, I'm realistically speaking still very junior. Because of that, I wouldn't mind getting back into the office for another year or so until I can credibly call myself a mid-level developer.

Until then, however, I'm just going to keep doing my best from wherever I end up working from.

Now, however, I'm exhausted so I'm going to get some rest. See you tomorrow!
