23:51 -- It'll be interesting the next few days to see if Vietnam extends the Corona Virus quarantine, or if things ease up and we head back to work at the company office.

Either way, being able to work at home for at least two weeks has brought its fair share of insights.

In any case, it's late so I'm going to get to bed and get some rest for tomorrow. See you then!
