# Thursday April 30th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

10:53 -- This morning I spent some time getting back to work on my FreeCodeCamp random quote machine again.

In this quick morning coding session I got the FCC test quite functioning in my project. Later today, I'll try modifying the UI a bit (changing some classes to ids for example), in order to fit FCC's requirements and get the basic UI tests passing.

Then, either tonight or tomorrow I'll try to implement functionality and finish the rest of the project.
