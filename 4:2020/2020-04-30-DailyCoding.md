# Thursday April 30th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

10:53 -- This morning I spent some time getting back to work on my FreeCodeCamp random quote machine again.

In this quick morning coding session I got the FCC test quite functioning in my project. Later today, I'll try modifying the UI a bit (changing some classes to ids for example), in order to fit FCC's requirements and get the basic UI tests passing.

Then, either tonight or tomorrow I'll try to implement functionality and finish the rest of the project.

22:00 -- Today was a decent day. I spent just under 3 hours on code related stuff today. I learned about how to include CDN test suites in a project this morning, and I also made some decent progress on the FCC random quote machine.

I'm still having trouble understanding why my links in that project are producing some unexpected behaviors, but once I figure that out I expect finishing the rest of the project will be fairly simple.

In any case, I also ate healthy food today, caught up on sleep, walked,and practiced some Vietnamese. That's enough chatting for now though. Let's get some sleep, and try to knock out the rest of the FCC random quote machine project tomorrow. :D
