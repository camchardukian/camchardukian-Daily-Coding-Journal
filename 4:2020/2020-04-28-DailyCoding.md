# Tuesday April 28th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:06 -- Here's what I did today at the office:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Researching/implementing React Native Firebase + Firebase Firestore

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:20
Researched a bit about Firebase Firestore database design

Reviewed other pull requests

Completed Q1 self-evaluation

Resources:
React Native Firebase Firestore: https://rnfirebase.io/firestore/usage

Notes:
We can use the .get() method to read the data from a collection or document one time.

If we want to see real-time changes in data, we can use the onSnapshot() method. 
```
22:07 -- Today I focused on trying to get React Native Firebase & Firebase Firestore working. I was successful.

I also accomplished a few other small tasks today, but my big takeaway today was understanding the basics of database design in Firebase Firestore.

I was able to understand most of what my senior colleague was telling me about his plans for how we should architect our database.

22:10 -- Of course, understanding something in theory and actually being able to build out some functions are two very different things. But, I'm going to strive to do both effectively! :D

Today was also an interesting day because I found out the director at my company seems to like how far I've come along professionally the past several months.

So, I've been chosen to be a mentor for some of the newer interns. This seems bizarre to me as in my heart I still feel like I'm super super junior.

However, I'm flattered to receive such an opportunity, and I'm looking forward to having my first real opportunity to work as a mentor to someone more junior than I am in the software industry.

That's enough blibber blabber for now. I need to catch up on some sleep. See you tomorrow!
