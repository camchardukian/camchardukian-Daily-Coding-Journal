22:57 -- A senior developer on my team left a really nice message for me after work today.

He said something along the lines of sincerely wanting to help me improve my coding abilities and that we will strive to do so through more regular pair programming sessions.

This is something I'm really looking forward to! :D

For now, however, I'm exhausted so I'm going to get some rest!
