# Saturday April 25th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:27 -- Today was a pretty laidback day. I spent some time reading and taking notes on OKR -- a really popular goal setting system amongst software development companies (though traditional companies could also benefit from its application).

I also pushed my notes that I took today to my Software Development Book Notes repo. Apart from that,I caught up on sleep a bit, relaxed, and worked on my Vietnamese today.

Tomorrow I'll continue reading and taking notes on the OKR book.
