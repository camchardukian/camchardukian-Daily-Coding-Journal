Notes:
```
23:20 -- Tomorrow I'll try to finish working on the Random Quote Machine project for FCC. I started that project like 5 weeks ago but have spent all my time working on other stuff since.

I want to take my four day weekend (Vietnam has off the next two days because of some national holidays), and really make some decent progress along the way to earning that FCC Front-End Libraries Certificate.

But, I'm not going to be earning anything else tonight. I'm exhausted. Let's get some rest, and continue grinding tomorrow! :D
