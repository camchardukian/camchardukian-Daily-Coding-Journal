Notes:
```
20:55 -- I'm really digging the current life balance. ~45 hours of coding per week + 20 hours of language learning.

The ultimate level of gnarly would be 50+ hours of coding and 25+ hours of language learning but let's hold our horses and slowly try building up to it :D 

20:57 -- See you tomorrow!
