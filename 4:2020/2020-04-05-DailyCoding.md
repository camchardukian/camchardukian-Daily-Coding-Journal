# Sunday April 5th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:54 -- Today I read some slack messages, and looked over a teammate's pull request, but mostly focused on refreshing myself for the coming week, after having spent roughly ~50 hours per week coding on average the last several weeks.

Hopefully tomorrow we can hit the ground running again! :D
