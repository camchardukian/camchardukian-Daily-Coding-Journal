Notes:
Math.trunc() is a function that will return an integer from a decimal value. Math.trunc() works by by taking a number and simply removing the digits that come after the decimal place. Math.trunc() does NOT round the number up or down.
```
19:39 -- Tomorrow I'll spend some time researching React Native Firebase. See you then!
