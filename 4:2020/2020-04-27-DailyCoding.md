# Monday April 27th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:28 -- Today was a pretty dull day at the office. I spent virtually the entire day hacking around the Java files in my company's React Native project to try to debug some issues.

In the end, however, my superiors came to their senses and realized that even if we got this approach to work, it would be a waste of time for us to try to build on top of such a shaky foundation.

So, instead of doing that, we're doing a different approach tomorrow. Anyway, today was the first day back at the office after the roughly 1 month quarantine period in Saigon.

Here's what my first day back looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Debugging React Native Firebase bugs

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:20
Continued debugging React Native Firebase bugs

Beginning of sprint planning meeting

23:33 -- Apart from this day at the office, I also spent an hour or so continuing to read and take notes on the OKR book.

I'll finish that book tomorrow, and then use the knowledge I've gained from that book to try to set some personal OKRs for myself for some clarity on what exactly I want to accomplish in my personal life before the end of the year.

Anyway, it's getting late so I need to get to bed. See you tomorrow!
