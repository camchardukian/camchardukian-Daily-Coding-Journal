# Tuesday April 7th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

22:46 -- Today was a pretty good day. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Continued working on the edit part 1 student profile task

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 18:00

Resources:

Failed to execute ‘importScripts’ on ‘WorkerGlobalScope’: 
https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6035

How to set Formik initialValues using async API call:
https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/issues/1033

Notes:
We can use ‘ctrl + shift + alt + r’ to start and stop recording our screen on ubuntu
```
22:47 -- Overall it was a pretty good day. I feel like I'm finally starting to get a pretty solid flow of how formik, react native, and redux saga work together.

In any case, we'll try to keep up the positive momentum tomorrow! :D
