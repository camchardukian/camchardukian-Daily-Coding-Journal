# Saturday April 18th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:45 -- Today was a decent day. I spent about 2 hours working on the company project and strengthening my knowledge in React Hooks among other things.

Lately I've been starting to exercise again. I started on I think Wednesday.

I've found that exercising is a great way too refreshen the mind after a long day at work so that I still have energy to dedicate to other pursuits like learning Vietnamese, reading documentation, or working on my side projects.

In any case, it's late so I'm going to get to sleep. See you tomorrow!
