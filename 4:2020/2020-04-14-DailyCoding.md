# Tuesday April 14th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

I must regretfully admit that last night I procrastinated and didn't get around to writing this journal entry so I'm getting it in the books a little late.

In any case, here's what I did at work yesterday:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Researched Firebase

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 18:20
Listened to a tech talk given by one of my coworkers

Started working on filter job list function

Using Firebase can reduce development time, especially for hobby projects:

Notes:

Sometimes we’re going to have issues with reusable components that we’re not able to debug ourselves. Sometimes, even the legendary Google may not be able to help us. In cases like these it can be helpful to skim through the package’s/library’s issue tabs on GitHub to see if 
anyone else is having a similar problem, as well as how the community fixed said issue.

Firebase is a framework that uses a RESTful API to communicate with Google’s noSQL database.

Firebase works across a number of platforms, Node, Python, C#, Java, etc.

Firebase is supported by Google.

Realtime synchronization between different clients and the backend almost instantaneously.

Basically, Firebase is ideal for applications with modern user interfaces that deal with JSON data, especially chat and GPS system apps.
