# Thursday April 16th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:35 -- Today was a bit of a frustrating day. I felt like I was just banging my head against the wall all day and couldn't get things to work.

Plus, my normal manager is pretty ill. He's not expected to come back to work until sometime next month.

Unfortunately, the only senior React Native developer at my company is horribly unresponsive when working from home.

I'm not sure if he's super busy, or if he's just taking advantage of the company's WFH policy, but the last week or so it's often taken him 3+ hours to respond to my messages.

This, plus the fact that his English is extremely limited have combined to make work a bit frustrating this week.

While I can't control his responsiveness I can take responsibility for the fact that I'm asking him to speak English by instead improving my Vietnamese so the burden of communication can instead lay on my shoulders.

That's why I've gotten back to studying Vietnamese hardcore the last few days. But enough of my ranting, here's what I did at the office today:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Continued working on filter job list function

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 17:20
Continued working on filter job list function

Set OKRs for the upcoming quarter
Resources:

Notes:
```
23:39 -- Hopefully I can get some mentoring tomorrow, or somehow finally break through this sticking point on my own. Good night -- see you tomorrow.
