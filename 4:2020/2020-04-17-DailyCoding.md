# Friday April 17th 2020 Daily Coding Journal

23:22 -- Man oh man, it's been a tiring week. Here's what I did at work today:
```
8:00 - 11:45
Daily standup meeting

Caught up on Slack/email

Continued working on filter job list function

Started watching and taking notes on React Hooks course recommended by a senior React 
Native developer on my team

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/Nap

12:45 - 18:20
Team OKR meeting

Continued working on filter job list function

Wrote a 650+ word post in company slack suggesting some possible ideas to remedy 
communication problems some divisions of the company have had while working remotely.

Notes:
setState() in class components in React merges state, while the useState hook inside of functional components replaces state.

If we want to merge state while still using the useState hook, we can use the spread operator followed by the piece of state we‚Äôd like to change.
```
23:23 -- Today was interesting in that I realized I can listen to Vietnamese programming videos at 0.75x speed and still get most of the main ideas they're trying to present.

I was geeking out when I realized I could do that lol.

Apart from that, nothing was super notable about today. I may do some additional coding this weekend on some particularly difficult parts of the code base that have stumped me the last few days.

In any case, I'm going to do some exercise and do some more Vietnamese flash cards before going to sleep. See you tomorrow.
