23:56 -- Today was my 150th working day (not counting weekends and other non-work days), as an employed developer.

That's 150 long days striving to improve. We've come a looooooong way since we first got started in August, and I'm looking forward to continuing to improve! :D

Tomorrow is a holiday so I'm off the 9-5 grind, but I'll still try to spend a little time on some side project.
