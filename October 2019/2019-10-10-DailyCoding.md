# Thursday October 10th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:10 -- Today had some moments where I felt natural doing ReactJS development today. There were other moments I felt frustrated being unable to debug what ended up being very simple bugs.

In any case, I've now spent 35 days inside the office doing web development. While I have somewhat limited control of whether my contract will be renewed as it expires in the near future,it does feel good to know that nobody will be able to take away all the experience I've gained in the last 7 weeks or so.

In any case, here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Added basic styling for error modal

Started working to add loading indicator prior to crop feature image to be cropped having fully uploaded

Converted error modal to confirm dialog

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 4:00
Finished profile image crop & background image upload bug fixes.

4:00 - 5:45
Made pull request for bug fixes, refactored code after receiving feedback from team leader, and made another pull request.

Reviewed some tasks and prepared some things for work on Friday (tomorrow).
