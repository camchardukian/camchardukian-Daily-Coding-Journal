# Thursday October 31st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:08 -- Happy Halloween! Today has been a solid day of code. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Cleaned up code from student account settings PR and added conditional class assignments to footer component elements to show which footer item is active.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:10
Finished refactoring code from the account settings PR to production level and had the PR merged.

Started working on the change password page.
```
20:11 -- I also took notes on chapter 6 in The Art of Readable Code.

I guess I'll continue with reading chapter 7 until my date for Halloween arrives.

20:33 -- I just finished reading and taking notes on chapter 7. Yeah baby! Now I'm going to push this entry to GitHub and maybe walk around the city a bit before bed.
