# Thursday October 24th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

20:42 -- Today was paradoxically both a pretty good day and a pretty bad one. Because I've been working so much lately, and because today's problem was pretty difficult, I was absolutely burnt by the middle of the afternoon.

On the bright side, however, the company I've been working for has recognized my growth and efforts to contribute to my team even as a new developer.

As a result, the company would like to continue working with me. It's great to be recognized for putting in long focused hours each week.

We'll maybe talk more about that in a few weeks when everything gets finalized.

For now, here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Worked on the personal view life experience page/ticket.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:15
Clarified different requirements on a number of different issues with QC and worked on fixing the personal view life experience page/ticket.

20:47 -- Today was a fairly week day as far as my developer output was concerned, but I'm going to do my best to get a solid night of rest tonight and get back to producing great work tomorrow! :D
