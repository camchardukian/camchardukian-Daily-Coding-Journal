# Wednesday October 9th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal
21:17 -- It's getting late. Let me quickly write this journal entry and then scoot to bed. Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Fixed connections list bug after researching about history.length. 

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 3:00
Added links for profiles, fixed some layout bugs, and added conversation accessibility.

3:00 - 5:45
Fixed profile image crop/upload & background image upload:

(Added cursor pointer on hover — finished,
Added popup modal for when users uploads a file that is too large).

Notes:
— The React Router replace() method can be used if we are on the first page of a website/app and we click on a second page that redirects to a third page. We of course, wouldn’t want our third page’s back button to go to the second page because then the second page would redirect straight to the first page again. Thus, we could use the replace method to instead go back to the first page from the third page.
