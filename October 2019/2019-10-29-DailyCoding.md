21:01 -- After work, I also read and took notes on chapter 4 of *The Art of Readable Code*.

The book has been a pretty good read thus far, but reading it has made me feel like my weakness as a developer is much more understanding the nunances and "gotchas" of React than my ability to think logically.

Which... I guess is a good thing in the long-term.

Anyway, it's getting pretty late now and I'd like to get in a little bit of exercise before bed. See you tomorrow!
