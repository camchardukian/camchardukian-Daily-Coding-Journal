# Wednesday October 30th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal
22:13 -- More than halfway through theweek already baby! But... I'm not sure why I'm cheering about that as I work 7 days a week anyway lol.

Aaaaaanyway, here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Cleaned up code from forgot password task and submitted PR

Started designing UI for student account settings page

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 6:00
Finished the account settings page.

Notes:
— When developers comment 'LGTM' on pull requests, it means “Looks good to me”.

— ‘Dp’ is short for density independent pixel.

— After doing some research I discovered that there seems to be some problems in the Material UI icon documentation and that we instead need to refer to the node_modules within our project.

22:17 -- Tonight I also read and took [notes on chapter 5 of *The Art of Readable Code*](https://github.com/camchardukian/Software-Development-Book-Notes/blob/master/The%20Art%20of%20Readable%20Code/Chapter_5-Notes.md).

22:18 -- In any case, it's getting late and I need to get some sleep to get ready for tomorrow.
