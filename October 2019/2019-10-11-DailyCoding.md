# Friday October 11th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

23:43 -- Just finished another week at the office. I feel like each week my skills are getting a bit better.

This shouldn't come as any surprise of course, given that I've been putting in 45+ hours at the office and programming on my own time each week.

Tonight was also fun because I got to meet a web designer/illustrator as well as one of my favorite bloggers from a few years ago.

Anyway, it's almost midnight and I have to teach some classes tomorrow morning starting at 8am so let me finish this commit and get to bed. 

Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
Day 36 (Friday 11/10) at C2C TechHub

7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Fixed bug about back button not displaying on profiles of other users.

Worked on connections list cancel button and adding ‘x’ icon.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:45
Worked on connections list cancel button and adding ‘x’ icon.

Updated some CSS styles (changed line-height so letters wouldn’t get cut off, and changed color of test/input text to better match styles on the app).

Converted .pdf image to .svg and started researching about how to style .svg images in React.

Notes:

In React we can give input elements an onFocus event handler.

We can style .svg images using CSS.
