# Thursday October 17th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:05 -- Today was another really long day at the office. On the bright side, today I worked pretty independently.

Today was one of the first time I felt like a "legit" junior developer in that while I still had some questions from time to time, my knowledge base was sufficient enough to be useful to my team.

I do think, however, that I and the other developer working on the social networking site didn't make enough progress to reach our goal for the sprint.

I'm curious about whether tomorrow things will be fine, or whether their will be any issues with our progress.

Hopefully there's no big problems as I'm nearing the end of my contract.

In any case, here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Finished updated UI for mentor public view page.

Redesigned the connections list page per new specs.

Did some brief planning, and started implementing the add a connection via public profile feature.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 7:00
Continued implementing how to add a connection through a public profile. Finishing the majority of adding/removing connections, and also almost finished designing the UI.

22:15 -- With 10+ of focus coding today, and probably about 20 hours over the last two days, my abilities as a developer are continuing to improve.

I think I'm just months... and not years away from being able to do client work as a developer.

For now, however, let's just get some rest and hopefully not run into any issues tomorrow.
