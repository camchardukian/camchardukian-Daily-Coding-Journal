22:02 -- On to good news and bad news...

The bad news is that the project I've been working on for the last couple months has been put on hold.

The good news is that there seems to be another project so I won't be out of work.

The other bad news, however, is that this next project seems to have a stricter deadline than the previous project.

In any case, I'll talk more about my general situation as a developer (without getting into details as to respect the company I'm working for), as my career continues to develop.

For now, good night!
