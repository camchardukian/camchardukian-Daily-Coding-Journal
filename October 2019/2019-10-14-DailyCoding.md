# Monday October 14th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:53 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Refactored code for connections list and styled .svg image.

Fixed bug that allowed mentees to view the connection lists of other mentee/mentors.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:10
Fixed ui regarding plane icon only displaying for users logged into mentee accounts and not those logged into mentor accounts.

Started working on bug about the profile page displaying incorrectly after being reloaded.

Fixed error with props, but not yet finished fixing key error.

Notes:
To edit a commit message without editing any of our code, or opening a text editor file, we can use ‘ git commit —amend -m “new commit message here” ‘

To create a container with all of its children evenly spaced, we can use display: flex, and justify-content: space-between on a parent, and then display-flex on the children. 

Resources:
Flexbox Froggy for becoming more comfortable with CSS flexbox: https://flexboxfroggy.com/
```
21:54 -- While I still feel that I'm pretty slow at implementing new features (in comparison with other developers), I do feel that I am becoming much more independent as the weeks go on.

21:55 -- I'm going to eat a little, exercise a little, and then get ready for bed.
