Notes:
We can use git reset filename.txt to “un-add” a single file we’ve already staged and prepared to be committed.

Likewise, we can use git reset to remove all files we’ve already staged and prepared to be committed.

We can use the history prop from ‘react-router-dom’ to go back to the previous page using a back button.
