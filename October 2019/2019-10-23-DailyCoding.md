# Wednesday October 23rd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal
22:04 -- I'm feeling pretty brain dead. I've spend over 30 hours programming this week already. Add my English teaching from Sunday and I've done 35 hours of work this week already and it's only Wednesday.

I'm pretty brain dead so I'm not going to reflect too much on today.

Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Finished personal view bios section

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 6:30

Implemented block function onto public profile page.

Fixed back buttonâ€™s appearance on the profile page (should render white on this page, but black on all other pages)

Notes:

22:08 -- I don't have much else to say for now. Tomorrow should be an eventful today so we'll discuss things more deeply then...
