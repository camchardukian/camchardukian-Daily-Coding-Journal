# Sunday October 27th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal
21:25 -- I haven't really done anything related to code today. I've just felt pretty tired. I guess this isn't completely unexpected as it's been probably 6 weeks since I've had a single day off.

While I feel tired more often than I'd like, I can't believe how much progress I've made in my professional life over the last two months.

But, I just feel like I'm ranting tonight. I'm so tired. Yesterday I got a solid amount of extra coding practice in, so today I'll just take pride in the fact that I banked some $$$ this morning and I'm getting to bed early to catch up on sleep and revitalize myself for the coming week.

I'm going to commit this journal entry, and then get to bed. See ya later!
