# Monday October 7th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:40 — Today has been a fun day. I basically finished the profile picture upload and background image upload features at work. Unfortunately, I was in a bit of a hurry to meet a friend after work so I forgot to move my notes from the office to the cloud.

So… no notes about my day at the office today. In any case, I’d like to take a quick 10 minutes or so to review event handlers like onChange, as well as Refs.

22:51 — I just finished reading the React documentation about event handlers. Because I’m less familiar with Refs, I’ll take more detailed notes from the documentation article here:

— Refs are created using *React.createRef()*.

— We can attach a Ref to a React element by using the *ref* attribute.

— We cannot use the *ref* attribute on functional components because they don’t have instances.

— *ref* updates occur before both the *componentDidMount* and *componentDidUpdate* lifecycle methods.

22:59 — It’s been a good 20 minute study review session. I’m going to log my coding time for today and then get to bed.
