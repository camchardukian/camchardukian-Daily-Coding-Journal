# Sunday September 1st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:37 -- I've been running on a pretty low amount of sleep the last few days so I'm going to try to make it to bed early tonight to get 9+ hours of sleep.

21:38 -- Anyway, here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Continued working on image/background image upload/cropping feature.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 5:00
Continued working on image/background image upload/cropping feature.

Notes:
useState is a way of using state via React Hooks inside of our functional components.

```
21:41 -- Today wasn't a particularly special day. I'm just trying to keep getting a little bit better each day.

Today I got a bit more experience with the react-crop library, and I also learned a little bit about useState/React Hooks basics.

In any case, I'm going to get to bed now so that tomorrow I'll have more energy to not only focus at the office, but also hopefully have some extra energy to learn outside of office hours too!
