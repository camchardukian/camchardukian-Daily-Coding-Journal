# Monday October 21st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal
22:06 -- Today was a solid day of coding. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Refactored code for personal view bug fixes from yesterday, submitted a PR, added comments and explained logic to team leader.

Fixed bug regarding back button on connections list page.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 6:20
Fixed several bugs on the personal view page including see more…, character limits, formatting, not being able to submit with empty values, improved UI button utilizing conditional rendering.

— Moved all connection list tasks to ‘ready for test’, hopefully for the final time.

Notes:
— It is possible to select multiple permissible prop types in React. Here’s an example snippet of code that does just that:
PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.number]).

— We can use props inside of a validate.js file.

Redux form documentation:

```
22:10 -- Not too much stuff to note about today. I'm starting to get a little bit more comfortable with Redux-form, but I'd like to spend a weekend or so doing a course/reading up on it in the near future.

22:11 -- Well, it's getting late now so I'm going to get ready for bed. 

22:13 -- I just noticed that today I passed 1,100 lifetime hours dedicated to code between my office job and learning on my own time. Cool!
