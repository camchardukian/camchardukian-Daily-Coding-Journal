# Tuesday October 15th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:13 -- I put in some really solid hours into code today. Here's what my day at the office looked like:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Fixed bugs on bio page.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 7:00
Finished fixing bugs on bio page, and built most of the UI for the mentor public view page.

Notes:
Pristine means that no fields in a form have been modified yet.

If we set the enableReinitalize value to true inside of a Redux form, said form will reinitialize every time the initialValues prop changes.

We can use window.scrollY to see how many pixels the user has scrolled vertically from the top of the viewport.

22:16 -- As you can see, I didn't leave the office today until 7pm. I spent some extra time sharpening my skills after work. It's always great to put extra time in to advance your skills more quickly.

Now, however, I'm feeling exhausted! Time to push this journal entry to GitHub and then get to bed.
