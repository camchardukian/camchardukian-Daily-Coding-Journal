# Friday October 4th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

21:00 -- Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 9:00
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Implemented max file upload size, accepted file types features as well as image size specifications.

End-of-sprint-meeting

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 3:00
End of sprint meeting

Worked on implementing background image upload feature.

// use input fields with onChange event listener to invoke callback function to select afile.

// select file (out of only allowed file extensions, and without exceeding maximum size.

3:00 - 6:25
Built Redux and Saga and did most of the implementation for upload background image feature. Still debugging the following error:
{message: ""file" must be an object", code: 141}
code: 141
 message: ""file" must be an object"

21:05 -- As you can see, it was a solid day of work. I'm still feeling kind of puzzled on how to complete the background image upload feature.

I always just get an error of *file must be an object* no matter what I do. I get the concept, but for some reason I can't seem to get any of the values I need through to my Saga.

I'm feeling a bit worried about this, because my team lead really seemed to think I would be able to complete this task on my own once he left.

21:07 -- I'm still thinking about whether I should review React in general tomorrow, or try to head to the office (while it may be closed) to try to continue plugging away at this problem.

To be honest, though, I kind of feel like I'm just banging my head against the wall at this point and need to strengthen my fundamentals before I'll be able to beat this specific hurdle.

21:08 -- I'm going to exercise a little bit,and then get to bed. Tomorrow I have some new classes I need to teach English. These days I'm generally working 50, or even more hours each week.

As such, things are kind of chaotic. Tonight despite not being in the greatest of circumstances with this obstacle, I feel relatively at peace with myself.

I'm going to get to bed and then tomorrow see about what I can do to become a better ReactJS developer.
