# Monday October 21st, 2019 Daily Coding Journal
20:12 -- While it's still fairly early in the night, I'm pretty beat as far as my mental capacities are concerned. After 10+ hours of focused coding today, I'm excited to commit this journal entry to GitHub, get off the computer, and get some exercise. 

Here's what my day at the office looked like today:
```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.


8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Refactored code for adding/removing connections from public profile feature

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap


12:45 - 7:30
Fixing several bugs on the mentee/mentor personal view (basic information page):
— from to year logic.
— improved multi-line formatting.
— Optional fields no longer allow empty strings.
— Saving error.

Notes:
We can use the white-space property in CSS and give it a value of “pre-line” to include line breaks in our formatting (rather than ignoring the user’s intended formatting via their usage of the enter/return key.
