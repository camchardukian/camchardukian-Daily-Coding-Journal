# Saturday October 19th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:32 -- I didn't get to doing any real programming today, but I did catch up on 2.5 hours of sleep which is a win in itself.

I did about 47 hours of working as a developer plus learning code on my own time this week which is exactly the type of effort I strive to put in each week.

40 hours at the office, an average of an hour a day on my own time.

Anyway, I'll study about lifecycle methods tomorrow now that I'm all caught up on sleep.

I'll strive for 2 hours, but 1 hour will the minimum acceptable study time. Anyway, it's getting late now.

Good night!
