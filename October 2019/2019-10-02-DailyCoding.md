# Wednesday October 2nd, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:02 -- Today was a pretty decent day. As you may expect, there were no shortage of bugs that I got stuck on today.

However, I did get a lot of guidance from my team lead which was great for learning more about debugging and React in general.

Anyway, here's what my day at the office looked like today:

```
7:50 - 8:00
Connected keyboard.

Connected mouse.

8:00 - 11:45
Scrum meeting.

Caught up on Chatwork/email

Continued working on image/background image upload/cropping feature.

11:45 - 12:45
Lunch/nap

12:45 - 6:45
Password feature bug fix

Continued working on image/background image upload/cropping feature.

Notes:
It is possible to customize Material UI classes directly by assigning the Material UI component a className, then putting that className into CSS/SCSS and nesting the materialUI classes you want to style within the className you gave to the Material UI component in your JS file.

*git stash* does not stash untracked files. If we want to stash untracked files, we can use the command *git stash --include-untracked*

— It is possible to have multiple git stashes at once.

— :not() pseudoclass in CSS will select all elements that are not of a specific type.

— Some pretty strange bugs can occur if you forget to import the CSS/SCSS style file for the React Crop library.

— From my current understanding, resolve within a promise basically creates the value that said promise will return.

22:06 -- It's getting a little bit late now so I'm going to push this journal entry to GitHub, eat a snack, and then get ready for bed.
