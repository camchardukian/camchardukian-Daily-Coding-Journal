21:47 -- Yesterday I reached out to one of the earliest subscribers of [The Daily Developer show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRUPCpCWCL6Mr-0QWNje29Q/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) that I'm the host of.

I made an issue on one of her GitHub repos so that she could see what that was like and offered to help her with some of the JavaScript algorithms if she wanted me to make any more videos or pair program together.

It feels good to be able to give back and pay it forward after having had some great devs help me in my first month or so as a full-time developer.

In any case, I'm going to hang out with my girl for a little bit and then get to sleep.
