# Saturday October 12th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:26 -- Today I taught 4 hours of English or so in the morning, and I went shoe shopping as well because the shoes I've been wearing to work are over a year old. They look completely beat up now so I'm trying to find something more professional.

Unfortunately, they no longer sell the shoe I wanted in my size.

In any case, I lost some time due to shoe shopping as well as catching up on sleep because last night I only got 7 hours.

Today I also wasted some time. All in all, this week has still been very solid with almost 55 hours of productive work.

Tomorrow I'll teach more English, and try to cut out excessive time wasting.

Today the only thought I really gave to code was this journal. After this "one day break", however, I'm hoping to put in a solid hour or so of learning tomorrow.
