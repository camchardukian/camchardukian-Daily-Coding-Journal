# Friday October 18th, 2019 Daily Coding Journal

22:37 -- Today was a solid day. While only half of my workday was actually dedicated to coding due to meetings, a technical talk, and an event for women's day, I feel like I'm getting more and more solid with React and Redux-Saga.

Today I finished the add/remove connections from a public profile page, and also properly incorporated the different conditional rendering based on props/state so that everything on my web app appears the way it should in different use cases.

Anyway, today there was a bit of a rush to go to a social event after work so I forgot to bring my notes to add to this journal entry.

That's about all I have to say for now. This weekend I'll try to do some more studying of React lifecycle methods.
